      "Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage ± OH is a software workflow tool which uses an artificial intelligence \n",
      "(AI) algorithm to identify suspected findings on non-contrast brain CT studies in the medical care \n",
      "environment. The findings identified by the device include obstructive hydrocephalus. \n",
      "Radiological findings are identified by the device using an AI algorithm ± a convolutional neural \n",
      "network trained using deep-learning techniques. Images used to train the algorithm were sourced from \n",
      "datasets that included a range of equipment manufacturers including Toshiba, GE Medical Systems, \n",
      "Siemens, Philips, and Canon Medical Systems. This dataset, which contained over 200,000 CT brain \n",
      "imaging studies, was annotated by qualified and trained radiologists.  \n",
      "The performance of the GHYLFH¶V AI algorithm was validated in a standalone performance evaluation, \n",
      "in which the case-level output from the device was compared with a reference standard \u000bµJURXQG \n",
      "WUXWK¶\f\u0011 This was determined by two ground truthers, with a third truther used in the event of \n",

      "The device interfaces with image and order management systems (such as PACS/RIS) to obtain non-\n",
      "contrast brain CT studies for processing by the AI algorithm. Following processing, if any of the \n",
      "radiological findings of interest are identified in a non-contrast brain CT study, the device provides a \n",
      "notification to the image and order management system for prioritization of that study in the worklist. \n",
      "This enables users to review the studies containing features suggestive of these radiological findings \n",
      "earlier than in the standard clinical workflow. It is important to note that the device will never decrease \n",
      "a VWXG\\¶V existing priority in the worklist. This ensures that worklist items will never have their \n",

Machine learning can augment clinical decision-making and improve NCCTB scan \\ninterpretation. This retrospective detection accuracy study assessed the performance of radiologists assisted by a deep learn-\\ning model and compared the standalone performance of the model with that of unassisted radiologists.\\nMethods A deep learning model was trained on 212,484 NCCTB scans drawn from a private radiology group in Australia. \\nScans from inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings were included. Scan inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18\\xa0years and series \\nslice thickness ≤ 1.5\\xa0mm. Thirty-two radiologists reviewed 2848 scans with and without the assistance of the deep learning \\nsystem and rated their confidence in the presence of each finding using a 7-point scale. Differences in AUC and Matthews \\ncorrelation coefficient (MCC) were calculated using a ground-truth gold standard.\\nResults The model demonstrated an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 across 144 \\nNCCTB findings and significantly improved radiologist interpretation performance. Assisted and unassisted radiologists \\ndemonstrated an average AUC of 0.79 and 0.73 across 22 grouped parent findings and 0.72 and 0.68 across 189 child find-\\nings, respectively. When assisted by the model, radiologist AUC was significantly improved for 91 findings (158 findings \\nwere non-inferior), and reading time was significantly reduced.\\nConclusions The assistance of a comprehensive deep learning model significantly improved radiologist detection accuracy \\nacross a wide range of clinical findings and demonstrated the potential to improve NCCTB interpretation.\\nClinical relevance statement This study evaluated a comprehensive CT brain deep learning model, which performed strongly, \\nimproved the performance of radiologists, and reduced interpretation time. The model may reduce errors, improve efficiency, \\nfacilitate triage, and better enable the delivery of timely patient care.\\nKey Points \\n• This study demonstrated that the use of a comprehensive deep learning system assisted radiologists in the detection of a  \\n   wide range of abnormalities on non-contrast brain computed tomography scans.\\n• The deep learning model demonstrated an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 across  \\n   144 findings and significantly improved radiologist interpretation performance.\\n• The assistance of the comprehensive deep learning model significantly reduced the time required for radiologists to interpret  \\n  computed tomography scans of the brain.\\nKeywords Machine learning\\xa0· Supervised machine learning\\xa0· Tomography, x-ray computed\\xa0· Brain\\xa0· Artificial intelligence\\nAbbreviations\\n3D  Three-dimensional\\nAI  Artificial intelligence\\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article',\n",

In emergency medicine, NCCTB enables \\nrapid diagnosis and the provision of timely care to patients \\nwho might otherwise suffer substantial morbidity or mortal-\\nity [1 , 2]. Over 15 million NCCTB studies were conducted \\nin 2016 in the USA [3 ]. Even amongst expert radiologist \\nreaders, error patterns have been reported for infarct detec-\\ntion, extra-axial masses, and vessel thrombosis [4 , 5], with \\nclinician inexperience, fatigue, and interruptions appearing \\nto increase error likelihood [6 ]. To address these issues, \\nattempts have been made to develop artificial intelligence \\n(AI) systems to mitigate errors and assist clinicians with \\ninterpretation [7 ].\\nDeep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are \\na class of neural network designed to process multi-dimen-\\nsional image data. CNNs have been applied successfully to \\nmany domains of medicine [8 , 9] and have demonstrated \\nstrong image classification performance in radiology [ 10, \\n11]. Deep learning systems in radiology appear to improve \\nthe clinical finding detection ability of radiologists [10], par -\\nticularly junior clinicians [11 ], and have facilitated reduc -\\ntions in mean interpretation time [10, 12]. Most NCCTB \\ndeep learning systems developed, however, have been limited in scope, capable of detecting just a single or a \\nsmall number of clinical findings. Chilamkurthy et\\xa0al (2018) \\ntrained and validated a model that could accurately detect \\nfour critical clinical findings (including multiple haemor -\\nrhage types), using a dataset consisting of 313,318 NCCTBs \\nautomatically labelled using radiology reports [7 ]. Other \\ndeep learning systems have been developed to accurately \\ndetect intracranial haemorrhage [ 13], traumatic brain injury \\n[14], acute infarction [ 15], and dementia [ 16]. However, the \\nnarrow scope of extant systems limits their clinical utility. \\nThere is a trend toward increasing the clinical comprehen-\\nsiveness of deep learning systems for other modalities [10, \\n17] and considerable opportunity exists to improve the scope \\nof deep learning systems designed to facilitate NCCTB \\ninterpretation.\\nWe developed and evaluated a comprehensive deep learn -\\ning system designed to assist clinicians with the interpreta-\\ntion of NCCTB studies and provide notification of suspected \\nfindings. The system is indicated for use with non-contrast \\nbrain CT scans (brain kernel) of adult patients. Research \\nquestions included the following: (1) How does radiologist \\ninterpretation performance change when the deep learning \\nsystem is used as an assistant? (2) How does the comprehen-\\nsive deep learning model perform in comparison to experi-\\nenced practising radiologists?\\nMethod\\nStudy design\\nA retrospective multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) study was \\ndesigned to evaluate the detection accuracy of 32 radiolo-\\ngists with and without the aid of the deep learning system. \\nRadiologists first interpreted cases without access to the \\ndeep learning tool, and then re-interpreted the same set of \\ncases with assistance from the deep learning tool following \\na minimum 4-month (124-day) wash-out period.\\nModel development and evaluation involved NCCTB \\ndataset labelling and interpretation by three mutually exclu-\\nsive groups of radiologists performing distinct functions:\\n(1) Initial classification labelling of the wider dataset that \\nincluded both test and training data was performed by \\n143 consultant radiologists from Vietnam,\\n(2) Dawid-Skene consensus of the labels on the test dataset \\nwas calculated and ground-truth adjudication of these \\nlabels was performed by three specialist neuroradiolo-\\ngists from Australia, and\\n(3) Interpretation of the test dataset in the MRMC study \\nwas performed by 32 consultant radiologists from Viet -\\nnam.',\n",

A waiver \\nof consent for use of the de-identified CT data in this study \\nwas approved with consideration of Australia’s National \\nStatement of Ethical Conduct in Human Research.\\nOntology tree\\nAn ontology tree was developed, specifying clinical findings \\nand describing relationships between these findings (Sup-\\nplementary Materials ). Each of the 214 findings was defined \\nby a consensus of three Australian subspecialist neuroradi-\\nologists. Radiologists engaged in labelling and evaluation \\nwere trained to identify the NCCTB findings according to \\nthese definitions.\\nData\\nThis study involved the use of 215,332 NCCTBs, from \\n170,745 unique patients, which were drawn from a private \\nradiology group in Australia. Cases included scans from \\ninpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings. Inclusion cri-\\nteria were age ≥ 18\\xa0years and series slice thickness ≤ 1.5\\xa0mm. \\nNCCTBs underwent classification labelling for each child \\nfinding of the ontology tree and each was labelled by three \\nto eight radiologists. Labellers completed training prior to \\ncommencing, which involved familiarisation with the anno-\\ntation tool, reviewing the definitions of each finding, and \\npractice on a curated dataset of 183 NCCTBs. Labeller per -\\nformance was assessed with the F1 metric [18] and each \\ndemonstrated an F1 score > 0.50 before commencement. \\nEach radiologist was given the same data for each case but \\nwas blinded to labels generated by the other radiologists. \\nThe radiology report, patient age, and sex were provided, \\nalong with all series in the study, and paired CT or magnetic \\nresonance imaging (MRI) scans. A consensus classification \\nlabel for each finding in each case was generated as a score \\nbetween 0 and 1 using the Dawid-Skene algorithm [19]. \\nLocalisation labelling (3D segmentation and lateralisation) was performed for a subset of findings (Supplementary \\nMaterials). Labellers were provided with the positive local-\\nizable findings and were instructed to segment/lateralize \\nonly those findings. Segmentation maps were each labelled \\nby three radiologists.\\nTraining dataset\\nA subset of the data, comprising 212,484 NCCTBs (168,326 \\nunique patients), was used for training. Classification labels \\nwere used to train the model to detect findings. Parent find-\\nings were automatically labelled based on child labels. The \\nmodel learned from the original labels and the structure of \\nthe ontology tree. The segmented maps were used to train \\nthe model to produce overlay outputs.\\nTest dataset\\nA power analysis determined that a minimum MRMC test \\ndataset of 2848 cases (2419 unique patients) was required \\nto detect a mean difference in area under the receiver oper -\\nating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.02 in the detection \\naccuracy of 30 radiologists (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.8). Cases \\nwere drawn from the labelled dataset to achieve a sufficient \\nnumber of cases per finding while keeping the total number \\nof cases as low as possible. MRMC test dataset cases were \\nexcluded from model training at the patient level. Each case \\nin the test dataset underwent an adjudicated ground-truth \\nlabelling process to ensure a high-quality gold standard. \\nGround-truth labels were determined by one of three fellow -\\nship-trained subspecialist neuroradiologists who reviewed \\nthe Dawid-Skene consensus labels and the classification \\nlabels chosen by the initial three labellers. These neurora -\\ndiologists had access to anonymized clinical information, \\npast and future radiological investigations, and radiology \\nreports. They did not have access to the outputs of the deep \\nlearning model.\\nDeep learning model development\\nThe deep learning model consisted of an ensemble of five \\nCNNs trained using fivefold cross-validation. The model \\nhad three heads: one for classification, one for left–right \\nlocalisation, and one for segmentation. Models were based \\non the ResNet [20], Y-Net [21], and ViT [22] architec-\\ntures. A single ensemble model was trained on all findings \\nsimultaneously. Class imbalance was mitigated using class-\\nbalanced loss weighting and super-sampling of instances \\nwith segmentation labels. Study endpoints addressed the \\nperformance of the classification model (v1.0). A total of \\n144 findings were selected for inclusion in the AI model \\nduring the MRMC study based on clinical and statistical \\nconsiderations during model development. Included findings ',\n",

Beta values were chosen by the team of \\nsubspecialist neuroradiologists based on the criticality of the \\nfinding. The higher the criticality, the less tolerance for miss-\\ning a finding and thus a higher beta was chosen to improve \\nthe sensitivity of the model.\\nMRMC test dataset interpretation\\nThirty-two radiologists, each with 2 to 21\\xa0years of clinical \\nexperience after completion of radiology specialist training \\n(median = 8\\xa0years), each interpreted all 2848 cases in the \\nMRMC dataset. Patient age, sex, and the clinical stem of the \\nradiology request were shown but no radiological report or \\nother comparison images were provided. Radiologists were \\nasked to rate their confidence in the presence of each of \\nthe 214 findings in the ontology tree using a 7-point scale. \\nThe AI tool displayed findings detected by the deep learning \\nmodel, along with a measure of the model’s confidence. For \\na subset of findings, a segmentation overlay was displayed. \\nRadiologist interaction was performed on diagnostic-quality \\nmonitors and hardware. Interpretation times were recorded \\nby the DICOM viewing platform. Radiologists were trained \\non ontology tree definitions and the labelling methodology. \\nThey then independently evaluated all 2848 studies without \\nmodel assistance. After a wash-out period, training on use \\nof the AI tool was provided, and the same radiologists inde-\\npendently evaluated the studies again with model assistance.\\nAnalysis\\nThe primary objective of this study was to quantify the \\ndifference in radiologist detection performance with and \\nwithout assistance from the model. The secondary objec-\\ntive was to compare the performance metrics of unassisted \\nreaders with the standalone deep learning model. For the \\nprimary objective, differences in AUC and Matthews cor -\\nrelation coefficient (MCC) were calculated. AUC and \\nMCC were reported as primary metrics because AUC is \\na widely accepted machine learning performance metric \\nand the MCC provides a more informative indication of \\nclassifier performance than other metrics. Receiver operat-\\ning characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted; US Food and \\nDrug Administration (FDA) iMRMC v4.0.3 software and \\nthe generalized Roe and Metz model were used to analyse \\nradiologist performance (AUCs) with and without assis-\\ntance from the model [23, 24]. Bootstrapping was used to \\ndetermine if there was a statistically significant difference \\nin average radiologist performance for each finding between arms. The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (alpha  = 0.05) \\nwas used to control the false discovery rate accounting for \\nmultiple comparisons [25]. A difference in AUC greater \\nthan 0.05 was considered clinically significant [26]; clini-\\ncal non-inferiority was defined as the lower tail of the two-\\nsided 95% CI being greater than − 0.05, and clinical inferi-\\nority was defined as the upper tail of the two-sided 95% CI \\nbeing less than − 0.05. Statistical superiority was defined as \\nthe lower tail of the two-sided 95% CI being greater than \\nzero and statistical inferiority was defined as the upper tail \\nbeing less than zero [10]. A clinically significant MCC was \\nconsidered as a difference greater than 0.1. For the second-\\nary objective, the AUC of the model was compared to the \\naverage unassisted radiologist AUC for each finding using \\nthe same bootstrapping technique. Analyses were conducted \\nand verified by multiple researchers (C.T., J.S., L.D.S.P.). \\nThe methodology was verified by an independent professor \\nof biostatistics (G.H.).\\nResults\\nTraining and test dataset characteristics are outlined in \\nTable\\xa0 1. Model assistance improved radiologist interpre-\\ntation performance. Unassisted and assisted radiologists \\ndemonstrated an average AUC of 0.73 and 0.79 across the \\n22 parent findings, respectively. Three child findings had \\ntoo few cases to calculate reader performance (“enlarged \\nvestibular aqueduct”: 0, “intracranial pressure monitor”: 0, \\nand “longus colli calcification”: 1). Unassisted radiologists \\ndemonstrated an average AUC of 0.68 across the remaining \\n189 child findings. The lowest AUC was obtained for “intra-\\nventricular debris” (0.50, 95% CI = 0.49–0.51).

This study demonstrates \\na further advance in CT diagnostics through the use of com-\\nprehensive AI to aid a clinician’s detection of a range of \\nabnormalities on NCCTBs. The developed model encom-\\npassed 144 clinical findings and was validated in a large-\\nscale MRMC study. Reader performance when not assisted \\nby the model, varied enormously depending on the subtlety \\nand inherent subjectivity of the finding. The average AUC \\nfor unassisted readers across all findings was 0.68. The aver -\\nage AUC for the model alone was considerably higher at \\n0.93. When assisted by the model, radiologists significantly \\nimproved their performance across 91 clinical findings. One \\ndriver of high model accuracy was the large training dataset \\nof 212,484 studies, each individually labelled for 192 find-\\nings by multiple radiologists.\\nModel benefits were most pronounced when aiding \\nradiologists in the detection of subtle findings. The low \\nunassisted radiologist AUC of 0.57 for “watershed infarct” \\nindicated a performance that was little better than random \\nguessing. Ground-truth labelling for acute infarcts was \\nusually aided by diffusion-weighted MRI scans or follow-\\nup CTs. Diffusion weighting is the most accurate method \\nfor detecting acute infarcts as it detects signal related to \\nmicroscopic tissue changes. CT relies on macroscopic tis-\\nsue changes to produce a change in density. However, as \\ninfarcts age, they become more visible, allowing for clearer \\ndetection on follow-up CT studies. Model performance \\nfor “watershed infarct,” with an AUC of 0.92 (0.88–0.94), \\nindicated that although this finding proved difficult for \\nradiologists to detect, subtle abnormalities were generally \\nFig. 3  Performance improve-\\nment using the deep learning \\nmodel.

The \\nconsiderable improvement of the radiologists in detecting \\nthese infarcts when assisted by the model suggests that the \\nfindings on these studies were visible to the human eye \\neven though they were often missed in the unassisted arm \\nof the study. Further work is required to investigate the \\nmechanisms driving the gap between augmented reader \\nand model performance.\\nInterestingly, the model influenced the readers beyond \\njust improving their accuracy. In radiology, there is often \\na trade-off between recall (i.e. sensitivity) and precision. \\nThe balance is usually struck with the level of precision \\nbeing higher than the level of recall, typically because the majority of errors in radiology are errors of visual percep-\\ntion [27], which cause false negatives, and reduce recall. \\nVisual search by clinicians favours some parts of the image \\nover others. In contrast, CNNs tend to treat all parts of an \\nimage with the same level of scrutiny and can alert the radi-\\nologist to findings they would otherwise miss, raising their \\nlevel of recall. We found that by changing the beta level of \\nthe model for the thresholds for different findings, which \\naltered the balance of recall and precision of the model \\nfor those findings, we could alter the balance of recall and \\nprecision for the radiologists when assisted by the model. \\nBeta levels were chosen based on the criticality of the find -\\ning. The logic was that for critical findings, the cost of a \\nfalse positive is less than the cost of a false negative, so \\nideally, readers should favour recall over precision. For low \\nFig. 5  Non-contrast CT brain study demonstrating an intraventricular haemorrhage, along with an example of the decision support system’s user \\ninterface',\n",

As expected, readers favoured precision \\nover recall in the unassisted arm of the study. In the assisted \\narm of the study, the ratio of precision to recall was deter -\\nmined largely by the beta levels chosen for the findings. For \\nhigh criticality findings, recall was favoured over precision \\nas desired, whereas for low criticality findings, precision \\nremained favoured. Without losing precision, the recall \\nof the high criticality findings markedly increased when \\nassisted by the model. Thus, many of the largest gains in \\nperformance by the radiologists when assisted by the AI \\ntool were for clinically critical findings.The AUC of the model was greater for most findings \\nthan the mean AUC of assisted radiologists. This effect is \\nwell-recognized and is extensively described in the clinical \\ndecision support literature [ 10, 28]. Many findings in radiol -\\nogy are not entirely binary, and their presence or absence \\nmay be equivocal. The observation that radiologists did \\nnot always follow the predictions of the model most likely \\nreflects the equivocal appearance of the findings on those \\ncases. Many articles describe interobserver disagreement \\nin radiology, which is particularly true of acute infarction \\n[29, 30]. For findings such as extra-axial collection where \\nappearance is less often equivocal, radiologist performance \\nwas similar to the model.\\nFig. 6  A three-dimensional \\n(3D) visualisation of a single \\ncase containing multiple clinical \\nfindings demonstrating the 3D \\nfunctionality of the model.

A further limitation is that due \\nto the comprehensive anonymisation of the study dataset, \\nwe were unable to perform consecutive case selection to \\nbetter replicate real-world practice. Cases were instead ran-\\ndomly selected. A reduction in AUC of 0.05 was defined as \\nclinically significant and only cerebellar agenesis reached \\nthis level of inferiority. The remaining 16 findings that were \\nstatistically inferior showed only minor reductions in AUC \\nthat were not clinically significant according to subspecialist \\nneuroradiologists. The model’s benefits must be weighed \\nagainst the possible general risks associated with the use of \\nAI tools. Such risks (e.g. automation bias) could be realized \\nif the user has little understanding of the tool or if the tool \\nis used in an incorrect manner.

Mehan, MD, MBA\\nBACKGROUND: Intracranial hemorrhage is a critical ﬁnding on computed tomography (CT) of the head. This study compared the\\naccuracy of an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) model (Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma) to consensus neuroradiologist interpre-\\ntations in detecting 4 hemorrhage subtypes: acute subdural/epidural hematoma, acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, intra-axial\\nhemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage.\\nMETHODS: A retrospective stand-alone performance assessment was conducted on data sets of cases of noncontrast CT of\\nthe head acquired between 2016 and 2022 at 5 hospitals in the United States for each hemorrhage subtype. The cases were\\nobtained from patients aged ≥18 years. The positive cases were selected on the basis of the original clinical reports using natural\\nlanguage processing and manual conﬁrmation. The negative cases were selected by taking the next negative case acquired from\\nthe same CT scanner after positive cases. Each case was interpreted independently by up to 3 neuroradiologists to establish\\nconsensus interpretations. Each case was then interpreted by the AI model for the presence of the relevant hemorrhage subtype.\\nThe neuroradiologists were provided with the entire CT study. The AI model separately received thin ( ≤1.5 mm) and thick ( >1.5\\nand≤5 mm) axial series as available.\\nRESULTS: The 4 cohorts included 571 cases of acute subdural/epidural hematoma, 310 cases of acute subarachnoid hem-\\norrhage, 926 cases of intra-axial hemorrhage, and 199 cases of intraventricular hemorrhage. The AI model identiﬁed acute\\nsubdural/epidural hematoma with area under the curve of 0.973 (95% CI, 0.958–0.984) on thin series and 0.942 (95% CI,\\n0.921–0.959) on thick series; acute subarachnoid hemorrhage with area under the curve 0.993 (95% CI, 0.984–0.998) on thin\\nseries and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.945–0.983) on thick series; intraaxial hemorrhage with area under the curve of 0.969 (95% CI,\\n0.956–0.980) on thin series and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.953–0.976) on thick series; and intraventricular hemorrhage with area under\\nthe curve of 0.987 (95% CI, 0.969–0.997) on thin series and 0.983 (95% CI, 0.968–0.994) on thick series. Each ﬁnding had at\\nleast 1 operating point with sensitivity and speciﬁcity >80%.\\nCONCLUSION: The assessed AI model accurately identiﬁed intracranial hemorrhage subtypes in this CT data set. Its use could\\nassist the clinical workﬂow, especially through enabling triage of abnormal CTs.\\nCorrespondence to: James M.

There are\\n4 key subtypes that occur in different regions of\\nthe brain: epidural/subdural hematoma, subarachnoid\\nhemorrhage, intra-axial hemorrhage, and intraventric-\\nular hemorrhage.1,2The faster detection of intracra-\\nnial hemorrhage on head CT can enable more rapid\\nmanagement and intervention including surgery.3–5\\nThe use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to identify\\nintracranial hemorrhage on head CT has been pro-\\nposed to assist clinical care, especially by triaging\\nsuspected cases for more rapid interpretation by a\\nradiologist. There have been at least 13 computer-\\nassisted triage devices (CADt) cleared by the US\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) for intracranial\\nhemorrhage detection.6While these devices report\\nsubgroup performance for identiﬁcation of different\\nintracranial hemorrhage subtypes as an “intracranial\\nhemorrhage,”7,8the AI model assessed in the current\\nstudy (Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma) is the\\nﬁrst FDA-cleared CADt device to output all 4 identi-\\nﬁed intracranial hemorrhage subtypes.9It speciﬁcally\\nidentiﬁes acute subdural/epidural hematoma, acute\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage, intra-axial hemorrhage, and\\nintraventricular hemorrhage. It uses the same AI model\\nas the Annalise Enterprise (CTB module) device, which\\nis commercially available in some non-US markets and\\ncan identify 130 different radiological ﬁndings on head\\nCT (further description in Methods).\\nThis study calculated the performance of this AI\\nmodel by comparing its outputs to consensus neurora-\\ndiologist interpretations on a cohort of head CT cases\\nfor each of the 4 ﬁndings. The AI device was provided\\nseparately with thin ( ≤1.5 mm) and thick ( >1.5 and ≤5\\nmm) axial series as available from each case so that the\\nperformance on different slice thicknesses could be cal-\\nculated. The performance was also calculated for cases\\nbelonging to demographic and technical subgroups to\\ndetermine the generalizability of the device.\\nMETHODS\\nStudy Design\\nThe data from this study include protected health infor-\\nmation; some data may be available for research pur-\\nposes from the corresponding author upon reasonable\\nrequest.

It was conducted in accor-\\ndance with relevant guidelines and regulations includ-\\ning the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\\nAct. This report followed the Standards for Reporting of\\nDiagnostic Accuracy Studies (2015) reporting guideline.\\nCase Selection\\nThe cohorts for each of the 4 intracranial hemorrhage\\nsubtypes were selected in a consecutive manner on\\nthe basis of the original radiology reports. The posi-\\ntive cases were identiﬁed through a natural language\\nprocessing search engine (Nuance mPower Clinical\\nAnalytics) followed by manual report review. The neg-\\native cases were identiﬁed by taking the next negative\\ncase acquired on the same CT scanner after the pos-\\nitive cases to avoid temporal and technical bias. The\\ncohort size for each of the positive and negative cases\\nwas based on powering calculations as described\\nin the Statistical Analysis section below. When the\\ncohort had equal numbers of positive and negative\\ncases, the next negative cases were taken after each\\npositive case; when there were unequal numbers of\\npositive and negative cases, the next negative cases\\nwere taken after every Nth positive case on the basis\\nof the ratio of positive to negative cases to ensure\\nthe principles of consecutive selection applied. For\\nthe acute subdural/epidural hematoma cohort, the\\ncohort was also enriched to ensure that there were\\nat least 20% of positive cases for each of subdural\\nhematoma and epidural hematoma; it is noted that\\nmany epidural hematoma cases had coexisting sub-\\ndural hematoma (reﬂecting the infrequency of isolated\\nepidural hematoma in the clinical environment).\\nThe cohort considered all cases of CT of the head\\nperformed at a hospital including inpatient and outpa-\\ntient; there were no limitations on the original CT head\\nclinical indication. The CT head cases were obtained\\nfrom patients aged at least 18 years. The cases of head\\nCT were taken from unique patients; only the ﬁrst CT of\\nthe head from a given patient was included. It was pos-\\nsible for a case to be included across multiple cohorts\\n(eg, both intra-axial hemorrhage and intraventricular\\nhemorrhage).\\nAll cases were deidentiﬁed and underwent an image\\nquality review by an American Board of Radiology–\\ncertiﬁed neuroradiologist.

The model achieved\\nsensitivity >80% and speciﬁcity >80% for all 4 ﬁndings.\\nWhile acknowledging the test data sets are different\\nfor each device, these results are consistent with other\\nFDA-cleared intracranial hemorrhage CADt devices\\nincluding the Rapid ICH device (sensitivity, 96.8%; and\\nspeciﬁcity, 100%) and the Viz ICH device (sensitivity,\\n95%; and speciﬁcity, 96%).7,8,13–22However, this model\\nis the ﬁrst FDA-cleared CADt device that outputs all 4\\nsubtypes of intracranial hemorrhage.9\\nThe output of the subtype of intracranial hemorrhage\\ncan facilitate notiﬁcations to initiate speciﬁc next steps\\nin patient management. For example, the detection of\\nan acute subdural/epidural hematoma that may war-\\nrant surgical management could alert a neurosurgical\\nteam, whereas the detection of an intra-axial hemor-\\nrhage that is typically managed with medications and\\nwithout surgery might not alert the neurosurgical team.\\nThe output of the subtype of intracranial hemor-\\nrhage also provides users with more explainability of the\\nmodel outputs. By providing the subtype, the user has\\ninformation about the location of the identiﬁed intracra-\\nnial hemorrhage without it being shown on a segmen-\\ntation map. As has been noted on an assessment of\\na similar model for pneumothorax identiﬁcation, the\\nFDA regulations for a CADt device only permit devices\\nto output the binary classiﬁcation performance (the AI\\nmodel assessed here technically outputs a binary clas-\\nsiﬁcation for each of the 4 subtypes).23A segmenta-\\ntion output could otherwise further assist with explain-\\nability by demonstrating the location of the identiﬁed\\nintracranial hemorrhage.The performance of the model was broadly consis-\\ntent across sex, age, ethnicity, race, and manufacturer\\nsubgroups with the vast majority achieving sensitivity\\nand speciﬁcity >80%. For the minority of subgroups\\nthat did not achieve a sensitivity or speciﬁcity of at\\nleast 80%, all except 1 had small sample sizes of <15.\\nThe sensitivity for the age ≤65 years subgroup for the\\nthick series for acute subdural/epidural hematoma was\\n77.7% despite including 148 cases; we note that the\\noverall sensitivity was 82.5% and that these 2 values\\nhad overlapping 95% CIs.\\nWhen the model performance was calculated at the\\nsame operating point on both thin and thick series, it\\nhad better sensitivity on the thin series and better speci-\\nﬁcity on the thick series. This observation likely relates to\\nthe increased z-axis resolution on the thin series, which\\ncan facilitate better identiﬁcation of hemorrhage, espe-\\ncially for small hemorrhages that may only be present on\\na small number of slices. The thinner series, however,\\nalso have more noise that could lead to the model incor-\\nrectly identifying hemorrhage.24A consideration for clin-\\nical use may be the use of a lower operating point for\\nthick series to balance out this difference.\\nLimitations\\nA key limitation of this study is that it is a retrospective\\nstudy outside of the clinical workﬂow. As was noted in\\nthe similar assessment of a pneumothorax model, this\\nstudy therefore establishes the accuracy of the model\\nbut does not assess its impact on the clinical workﬂow\\nincluding for case prioritization and patient outcomes.23\\nThis initial step is necessary to ensure the model has the\\npotential to provide clinical beneﬁt. Further evaluation\\nwill be required moving forward to prove such beneﬁt.\\nAs part of the study design, the cohorts of cases\\nwere selected on the basis of the original radiology\\nreports and subsequently interpreted in a consensus\\nmanner by neuroradiologists. The rationale for this\\napproach is that the binary presence or absence of\\neach ﬁnding is conﬁrmed for every case on the basis of\\nthe radiologic images alone, which matches what the\\nmodel uses. It was, however, possible for the interpre-\\ntations to change between the original reports and the\\nneuroradiologist interpretations, especially given that\\nthe neuroradiologists did not have knowledge of the\\nclinical situation or access to longitudinal radiology\\nscans during their ground truth review. All cohorts had a\\nsmaller number of positive cases based on the consen-\\nsus neuroradiologist interpretations compared with the\\noriginal reports. These cases were considered ground\\ntruth negative for the analysis, and in cases where the\\nmodel identiﬁed them as positive, they were recorded\\nas false-positive cases with subsequently decreased\\nspeciﬁcity.

      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective standalone performance assessmen t was conducted on datasets of non -contrast CT head \n",
      "cases acquired between 2016 and 2022 for each finding. The cases were obtained from patients aged 18 years or older from five  \n",
      "hospitals in the United States. The positive cases were selected consecutively  based on the original clinical reports using natural \n",
      "language processing and manual confirmation. The negative cases were selected by taking the next negative case acquired from the \n",
      "same CT scanner after positive cases. Each case was interpreted independe ntly by up to three neuroradiologists to establish consensus \n",
      "interpretations. Each case was then interpreted by the AI model for the presence of the relevant finding. The neuroradiologis ts were \n",

      "INTRODUCTION \n",
      "Mass effect and vasogenic edema are critical findings on CT of the head and require emergent medical attention.1-3 Mass effect can be \n",
      "caused by various pathologies including tumor and hemorrhage. It manifests on CT with effacement of ventricles, basal cisterns or cerebral \n",
      "sulci; midline shift; and brain herniation including tonsillar herniation or uncal herniation. Vasogenic edema can similarly be caused by \n",
      "various pathologies and manifests as a deep white matter hypodensity extending into subcortical white matter. \n",
      "Like the identification of large vessel occlusion and intracranial hemorrhage on head CT,4, 5 the identification of mass effect and vasogenic \n",
      "edema by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms could assist clinical care by triaging suspected cases for sooner interpretation and enabling \n",
      "sooner treatment. While there have been at least fifteen computer assisted triage devices (CADt) cleared by the US Food and Drug \n",
      "Administration (FDA) for intracranial hemorrhage, there are far fewer for mass effect and vasogenic edema.6-8 This paper describes the \n",
      "performance of the Annalise Enterprise (CTB module) device, which is available in many non-US regulatory jurisdictions and can identify \n",
      "130 different radiological findings on head CT.9 In the US, the two findings of mass effect and vasogenic edema have received FDA \n",
      "clearance as separate devices including as the first CADt device to identify vasogenic edema.10, 11 \n",
      "This study was a standalone model performance assessment for the identification of mass effect and vasogenic edema: it compar ed the \n",
      "accuracy of the AI device to consensus neuroradiologist interpretations in detecting these findings. Similar to a prior study for intracranial \n",
      "hemorrhage,12 the device was provided se parately with thin (≤1.5mm) and/or thick (>1.5 and ≤5mm) axial series from each case so that \n",
      "the performance on different slice thicknesses could be calculated. The performance was also calculated for cases belonging t o \n",
      "demographic and technical subgroups to determine the generalizability of the device.  \n",
      " \n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS \n",
      "Study design \n",
      "This retrospective standalone model performance study was conducted using radiology cases from five hospitals within the Mass General \n",
      "Brigham network between 2016 and 2022 using similar methods to a previously published study about intracranial hemorrhage \n",
      "identification.12 The study examined the performance for the binary detection of mass effect and vasogenic edema by the AI model. It was \n",
      "approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board with waiver of informed consent. It was conducted in accordance with \n",
      "relevant guidelines and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This manuscript follows the \n",
      "Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD 2015) reporting guideline. \n",
      " \n",
      "Case selection \n",
      "The cohorts for mass effect and vasogenic edema were selected in a consecutive manner based on the original radiology reports. The cohort \n",
      "size for each of the positive and negative cases was based on powering calculations as described in the statistical analysis section below. \n",
      "The positive cases were identified through a natural language processing search engine (Nuance mPower Clinical Analytics) followed by \n",
      "manual report review. The negative cases were identified by taking the next negative case acquired on the same CT scanner after the \n",
      "positive cases to avoid temporal and technical bias. The next negative cases were taken after every Nth positive case based on the ratio of \n",
      "positive to negative cases to ensure the principles of consecutive selection applied. \n",
      "The cohort considered all CT head cases performed at a hospital including inpatient and outpatient; there were no limitations on the original \n",
      "CT head clinical indication. The CT head cases were obtained from patients at least 18 years of age. The CT head cases were taken from \n",
      "unique patients; only the first CT head from a given patient was included. It was possible for a case to be included in both cohorts (i.e., \n",
      "both mass effect and vasogenic edema); there were 8 cases in both cohorts.  \n",
      "All cases were deidentified and underwent an image quality review by an American Board of Radiology-certified neuroradiologist. The \n",
      "relevant series for the model interpretations were selected at the same time as described under the series selection section below. The \n",
      "review was performed using the FDA-cleared eUnity image visualization software (Version 6 or higher) and an internal web-based \n",
      "annotation system that utilized the REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Mass General Brigam.13, 14 \n",
      " \n",
      "Series selection \n",
      "The model was provided with a single selected series at the time of model inference. These series were non-contrast thin (≤1.5mm) and/or \n",
      "thick (>1.5 and ≤5mm) axial series for each CT head case. The series were selected such that the thin series was the thinnest  available \n",
      "series ≤1.5mm; the thick series was randomized between the thinnest and thickest available series >1.5 and ≤5mm to ensure representation \n",
      "of series thicknesses across the entire range. The series were selected at the same time as the image quality review. After series selection, \n",
      "a DICOM metadata review was additionally performed to ensure that the slice thickness was within the appropriate range and that there \n",
      "was a consistent slice interval (with tolerance of ±0.2mm).  \n",
      " \n",
      "Ground truth interpretations \n",
      "Ground truth interpretations were performed by up to three ABR-certified neuroradiologists. They answered whether the relevant finding \n",
      "was “Present” or “Absent”. The definition for mass effect was “mass effect as evidenced by effacement of ventricles, basal ci sterns or \n",
      "--- Page4 ---\n",
      " 3 \n",
      " cerebral sulci, midline shift, or brain herniation (e.g., to nsillar herniation or uncal herniation)”. The definition of vasogenic edema was \n",
      "“deep white matter hypodensity extending into subcortical white matter”. The neuroradiologists also answered whether a “paren chymal \n",
      "abnormality including ischemia / mass / cyst / encephalomalacia” was present. They provided their interpretations independently, without \n",
      "access to the original radiology reports and in different worklist orders. They used the same image visualization software and annotation \n",
      "system as was used in the image quality review. They had access to the entire CT head case (i.e., were not restricted to the series selected \n",
      "for model inference). For determining consensus interpretations for the presence of mass effect or vasogenic edema, a “2+1” s trategy was \n",
      "used: the first two neuroradiologists interpreted every case and a third neuroradiologist then interpreted cases with discrepant \n",
      "interpretations. A parenchymal abnormality was considered present if either of the first two neuroradiologists annotated it as present; the \n",
      "third neuroradiologist was not asked about its presence. \n",
      " \n",
      "Model inference \n",
      "The evaluated AI model was version 3.1.0 of the Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma device. It is the same AI model used by the \n",
      "Annalise Enterprise (CTB module) device, which is commercially available in some non-US markets and whose development has been \n",
      "previously described.9 In brief, it consists of an ensemble of five neural networks with three heads: one for classification, one for left-right \n",
      "localization and one for segmentation. It can identify 130 different radiological findings and was trained on over 200,000 CT head cases, \n",
      "which were each labelled by at least three radiologists. These training cases came from 8 different scanner manufacturers and over 90 \n",
      "different scanner models. The training cases were completely independent of the cases used for this standalone model performance study. \n",
      "The Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma device only provides binary classification outputs about the identification of findings, which \n",
      "is consistent with FDA regulations for CADt devices. The model was installed at MGB for use in this study and received only the DICOM-\n",
      "formatted CT head cases. It outputted a classification score between 0 and 1 for mass effect and vasogenic edema. A binary output for \n",
      "these findings could be derived using prespecified operating points. As part of model inference, the device contains multiple filters to look \n",
      "at attributes of the series to be interpreted to ensure the model does not perform inference on unsuitable images; in these situations, the \n",
      "device does not p roduce an output and is referred to as “unsuccessful model inference” within this study. While not part of the current \n",
      "study, internal bench testing indicated a model turn-around time of 81.6 seconds (95% CI: 80.3 to 82.9 seconds).10, 11 \n",
      " \n",
      "Statistical analysis \n",
      "The statistical analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.2) on the full analysis set. The predefined endpoints included the areas under the \n",
      "receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the identification of mass effect and vasogenic edema for each of thin and thick series. \n",
      "The AUCs were calculated using the consensus annotations and the classification scores from the AI model. The prespecified endpoints \n",
      "also included the sensitivity and specificity at predetermined operating points; this paper reports the performance at operating points that \n",
      "have received FDA clearance. They were calculated by comparing the binary model output at each operating point with the consensus \n",
      "annotations (i.e., by calculating the number of true positive, false negative, true negative and false positive cases).  \n",
      "The positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated as exploratory analyses at an assumed \n",
      "prevalence of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20. The sensitivities and specificities were calculated as exploratory analyses for the subgroups of \n",
      "presence or absence of a parenchymal abnormality. The AUCs, sensitivities and specificities were calculated as exploratory analyses for \n",
      "the subgroups of sex, age, ethnicity, race and CT scanner manufacturer. These parameters were derived from clinical databases or DICOM \n",
      "fields for each radiology case. Any missing data were treated a s “Unknown” or “Unavailable” and no data were imputed.  \n",
      "All CIs were calculated using bootstrapped intervals with 2,000 resamples. The sample sizes for each of the findings were powered based \n",
      "on preliminary model results at a balanced operating point to ensure the lower bound of the 95% CI for sensitivity was >80% and for \n",

      "DISCUSSION \n",
      "This retrospective standalone model performance study assessed the ability of an AI device to identify mass effect and vasogenic edema \n",
      "on head CT. For mass effect, the AI device achieved AUC 0.987 on thin series and AUC 0.983 on thick series. For vasogenic edema, it \n",
      "achieved AUC 0.980 on thin series and AUC 0.988 on thick series. These AUCs, as well as the lower bounds of their 95% CIs, are in \n",
      "excess of the benchmark AUC of 0.95 that the FDA uses for CADt devices cleared under the QFM product code.15 Both devices also had \n",
      "operating points that corresponded to sensitivity and specificity of at least 89.8%. These sensitivities and specificities, as well as the lower \n",
      "bounds of their 95% CIs, are in excess of the benchmark sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 80% that the FDA commonly uses for CADt \n",
      "devices cleared under the QAS product code (which was the product code through which these two findings were cleared).10, 11, 16  \n",
      "The proposed benefit of CADt devices is that they are “intended to aid in prioritization and triage of radiological medical images”17 such \n",
      "that clinicians will be aware of abnormal studies sooner and can commence subsequent management steps. There are two other CADt \n",
      "devices that the FDA has approved for the identification of mass effect. The NinesAI device detects mass effect with sensitivity 96.4% \n",
      "and specificity 91.1%.7 The qER device detects mass effect with sensitivity 96.39% and specificity 96.00%, and midline shift with \n",
      "sensitivity 97.34% and specificity 95.36%.6 The current results are consistent, while noting that the cohorts for the assessment of each \n",
      "algorithm are different and therefore prevent direct comparison. \n",
      "One of the ongoing challenges with CADt devices cleared by the FDA is that the regulation states “device does not mark, highl ight, or \n",
      "direct users' attention to a specific location in the original image”.17 This assessment was therefore based on only the binary identification \n",
      "of mass effect or vasogenic edema, and did not incorporate a localization or segmentation analysis. As we have described previously, a \n",
      "localization output including a segmentation or heat-map could assist with explainability by demonstrating what the model has identified \n",
      "especially when a user suspects the algorithm has falsely identified a finding (i.e., a false positive case).12, 18, 19 The growing number of \n",
      "head CT findings that can be identified by CADt devices paves the way for application of AI in radiology to use cases requiring broader \n",
      "identification of findings such as report writing. \n",
      "--- Page6 ---\n",

      " This device demonstrated robust performance across sex, age, ethnicity, race and manufacturer subgroups. It achieved a sensitivity and \n",
      "specificity of at least 80% whenever there were at least 8 cases within a subgroup. This performance suggests that the device is \n",
      "generalizable for different patient demographics and technical parameters. The device will, however, encounter new scenarios when being \n",
      "used in the clinical environment and its ongoing performance should continue to be monitored. The device reassuringly also appeared to \n",
      "differentiate between an underlying parenchymal abnormality and mass effect or vasogenic edema, as suggested by its ability to maintain \n",
      "a specificity greater than 80% even when a parenchymal abnormality was present. \n",
      "As we have described for similar standalone model performance assessments, a key limitation of this study is that it is retrospective and \n",
      "outside of the clinical workflow.12, 18 It therefore establishes the accuracy of the model in identifying mass effect and vasogenic edema but \n",
      "does not assess its impact on the clinical workflow including for benefit on patient outcomes. We view this initial step as a prerequisite to \n",
      "ensure that the device has the potential to provide clinical benefit. Further evaluation will be required to prove such a benefit. \n",
      " \n",
      "CONCLUSIONS \n",
      "This standalone model performance assessment investigated the ability of an AI device to identify mass effect and vasogenic edema on \n",
      "head CT. It demonstrated performance that exceeded the FDA benchmarks for CADt devices. Its use could lead to improved care and \n",
      "outcomes for patients with these findings. \n",

Device Description\\n\\nBoneView is intended to analyze radiographs using machine learning techniques to identify\\nand highlight fractures during the review of radiographs.\\n\\nBoneView can be deployed on-premises or on cloud and be connected to several computing\\nplatforms and X-ray imaging platforms such as X-ray radiographic systems, or PACS. More\\nprecisely, BoneView can be deployed:\\n\\ne Inthe cloud with a PACS as the DICOM Source\\n\\ne@ On-premises with a PACS as the DICOM Source\\n\\ne@ On-premises with an X-ray system as the DICOM Source\\n\\nIt is important to note that no matter the deployment mode that is chosen for BoneView, the\\noverall principle of use of BoneView and its user interface remain the same; only the place\\nwhere BoneView is housed, and the DICOM Source/DICOM Destination with which BoneView\\ncommunicates, may vary. Below is a description of the data flow.\\n\\nAfter the acquisition of the radiographs on the patient and their storage in the DICOM Source,\\nthe radiographs are automatically received by BoneView from the user’s DICOM Source\\nthrough an intermediate DICOM node (for example, a specific Gateway, or a dedicated API). The\\nDICOM Source can be the user’s image storage system (for example, the Picture Archiving and\\nCommunication System, or PACS), or other radiological equipment (for example X-ray\\nsystems).\\n\\nOnce received by BoneView, the radiographs are automatically processed by the Al algorithm\\nto identify regions of interest. Based on the processing result, BoneView generates result files\\nin DICOM format. These result files consist of a summary table and result images (annotations\\non a copy of the original images or annotations to be toggled on/off). BoneView does not alter\\nthe original images, nor does it change the order of original images or delete any image from\\nthe DICOM Source.\\n\\nOnce available, the result files are sent by BoneView to the DICOM Destination through the\\nsame intermediate DICOM node. Similar to the DICOM Source, the DICOM Destination can be\\nthe user’s image storage system (for example, the Picture Archiving and Communication\\nSystem, or PACS), or other radiological equipment (for example X-ray systems). The DICOM\\nSource and the DICOM Destination are not necessarily identical.\\n\\nGLEAMER\\n5 avenue du Général de Gaulle, 94160 Saint-Mandé - FRANCE\\nSAS au capital de 115 372 euros - RCS Créteil 834 105 470\\nSIRET : 834 105 470 00027 - admin@gleamer.ai\\n\\x0c',\n",

In this regard, the display of\\nfindings is triggered by a “high-sensitivity operating point” (DOUBT FRACT) that will enable the\\ndisplay of a dotted-line bounding box around the region of interest. Additionally, the users\\nneed to be confident that when BoneView identifies a fracture, it is actually a fracture. In this\\nregard, an additional information is introduced to the user with a “high-specificity operating\\npoint” (FRACT).\\n\\nThese two operating points are implemented in the User Interface as follow:\\n¢ Dotted-line Bounding Box: suspicious area / subtle fracture (when the level of\\nconfidence of the Al algorithm associated with the finding is above “high-sensitivity\\n\\nGLEAMER\\n5 avenue du Général de Gaulle, 94160 Saint-Mandé - FRANCE\\nSAS au capital de 115 372 euros - RCS Créteil 834 105 470\\nSIRET : 834 105 470 00027 - admin@gleamer.ai\\n\\x0c',\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mass effect and vasogenic edema are critical findings on CT of the head. This study compared the\n",
      "accuracy of an artificial intelligence model (Annalise Enterprise CTB) to consensus neuroradiologist interpretations in detecting mass\n",
      "effect and vasogenic edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective standalone performance assessment was conducted on datasets of non-contrast CT head\n",
      "cases acquired between 2016 and 2022 for each finding. The cases were obtained from patients aged 18 years or older from five\n",
      "hospitals in the United States. The positive cases were selected consecutively based on the original clinical reports using natural\n",
      "language processing and manual confirmation. The negative cases were selected by taking the next negative case acquired from the\n",
      "same CT scanner after positive cases. Each case was interpreted independently by up to three neuroradiologists to establish consensus\n",
      "interpretations. Each case was then interpreted by the Al model for the presence of the relevant finding. The neuroradiologists were\n",
      "provided with the entire CT study. The Al model separately received thin (<1.5mm) and/or thick (1.5 and <5mm) axial series.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS: The two cohorts included 818 cases for mass effect and 310 cases for vasogenic edema. The Al model identified mass\n",
      "effect with sensitivity 96.6% (95% Cl, 94.9-98.2) and specificity 89.8% (95% Cl, 84.7-94.2) for the thin series, and 95.3% (95% Cl, 93.5-\n",
      "96.8) and 93.1% (95% Cl, 89.1-96.6) for the thick series. It identified vasogenic edema with sensitivity 90.2% (95% Cl, 82.0-96.7) and\n",
      "specificity 93.5% (95% Cl, 88.9-97.2) for the thin series, and 90.0% (95% Cl, 84.0-96.0) and 95.5% (95% Cl, 92.5-98.0) for the thick\n",
      "series. The corresponding areas under the curve were at least 0.980.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: The assessed Al model accurately identified mass effect and vasogenic edema in this CT dataset. It could assist the\n",

Th is study compared the \\naccuracy of an artificial intelligence model (Annalise Enterprise CTB) to consensus neuroradiologist interpretations in detec ting mass \\neffect and vasogenic edema.  \\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective standalone performance assessmen t was conducted on datasets of non -contrast CT head \\ncases acquired between 2016 and 2022 for each finding. The cases were obtained from patients aged 18 years or older from five  \\nhospitals in the United States. The positive cases were selected consecutively  based on the original clinical reports using natural \\nlanguage processing and manual confirmation. The negative cases were selected by taking the next negative case acquired from the \\nsame CT scanner after positive cases. Each case was interpreted independe ntly by up to three neuroradiologists to establish consensus \\ninterpretations. Each case was then interpreted by the AI model for the presence of the relevant finding. The neuroradiologis ts were \\nprovided with the entire CT study. The AI model separately rec eived thin (≤1.5mm) and/or thick (>1.5 and ≤5mm) axial series.  \\nRESULTS:  The two cohorts included 818 cases for mass effect and 310 cases for vasogenic edema. The AI model identified mass \\neffect with sensitivity 96.6% (95% CI, 94.9 -98.2) and specificity 89. 8% (95% CI, 84.7 -94.2) for the thin series, and 95.3% (95% CI, 93.5 -\\n96.8) and 93.1% (95% CI, 89.1 -96.6) for the thick series.

       " '\\n--- Page3 ---\\n2   \\nINTRODUCTION \\nMass effect and vasogenic edema are critical findings on CT of the head and require emergent medical attention.1-3 Mass effect can be \\ncaused by various pathologies including tumor and hemorrhage. It manifests on CT with effacement of ventricles, basal cisterns or cerebral \\nsulci; midline shift; and brain herniation including tonsillar herniation or uncal herniation. Vasogenic edema can similarly be caused by \\nvarious pathologies and manifests as a deep white matter hypodensity extending into subcortical white matter. \\nLike the identification of large vessel occlusion and intracranial hemorrhage on head CT,4, 5 the identification of mass effect and vasogenic \\nedema by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms could assist clinical care by triaging suspected cases for sooner interpretation and enabling \\nsooner treatment. While there have been at least fifteen computer assisted triage devices (CADt) cleared by the US Food and Drug \\nAdministration (FDA) for intracranial hemorrhage, there are far fewer for mass effect and vasogenic edema.6-8 This paper describes the \\nperformance of the Annalise Enterprise (CTB module) device, which is available in many non-US regulatory jurisdictions and can identify \\n130 different radiological findings on head CT.9 In the US, the two findings of mass effect and vasogenic edema have received FDA \\nclearance as separate devices including as the first CADt device to identify vasogenic edema.10, 11 \\nThis study was a standalone model performance assessment for the identification of mass effect and vasogenic edema: it compar ed the \\naccuracy of the AI device to consensus neuroradiologist interpretations in detecting these findings. Similar to a prior study for intracranial \\nhemorrhage,12 the device was provided se parately with thin (≤1.5mm) and/or thick (>1.5 and ≤5mm) axial series from each case so that \\nthe performance on different slice thicknesses could be calculated. The performance was also calculated for cases belonging t o \\ndemographic and technical subgroups to determine the generalizability of the device.  \\n \\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \\nStudy design \\nThis retrospective standalone model performance study was conducted using radiology cases from five hospitals within the Mass General \\nBrigham network between 2016 and 2022 using similar methods to a previously published study about intracranial hemorrhage \\nidentification.12 The study examined the performance for the binary detection of mass effect and vasogenic edema by the AI model. It was \\napproved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board with waiver of informed consent. It was conducted in accordance with \\nrelevant guidelines and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. This manuscript follows the \\nStandards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD 2015) reporting guideline. \\n \\nCase selection \\nThe cohorts for mass effect and vasogenic edema were selected in a consecutive manner based on the original radiology reports. The cohort \\nsize for each of the positive and negative cases was based on powering calculations as described in the statistical analysis section below. \\nThe positive cases were identified through a natural language processing search engine (Nuance mPower Clinical Analytics) followed by \\nmanual report review. The negative cases were identified by taking the next negative case acquired on the same CT scanner after the \\npositive cases to avoid temporal and technical bias. The next negative cases were taken after every Nth positive case based on the ratio of \\npositive to negative cases to ensure the principles of consecutive selection applied. \\nThe cohort considered all CT head cases performed at a hospital including inpatient and outpatient; there were no limitations on the original \\nCT head clinical indication. The CT head cases were obtained from patients at least 18 years of age. The CT head cases were taken from \\nunique patients; only the first CT head from a given patient was included. It was possible for a case to be included in both cohorts (i.e., \\nboth mass effect and vasogenic edema); there were 8 cases in both cohorts.  \\nAll cases were deidentified and underwent an image quality review by an American Board of Radiology-certified neuroradiologist. The \\nrelevant series for the model interpretations were selected at the same time as described under the series selection section below. The \\nreview was performed using the FDA-cleared eUnity image visualization software (Version 6 or higher) and an internal web-based \\nannotation system that utilized the REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Mass General Brigam.13, 14 \\n \\nSeries selection \\nThe model was provided with a single selected series at the time of model inference. These series were non-contrast thin (≤1.5mm) and/or \\nthick (>1.5 and ≤5mm) axial series for each CT head case. The series were selected such that the thin series was the thinnest  available \\nseries ≤1.5mm; the thick series was randomized between the thinnest and thickest available series >1.5 and ≤5mm to ensure representation \\nof series thicknesses across the entire range. The series were selected at the same time as the image quality review. After series selection, \\na DICOM metadata review was additionally performed to ensure that the slice thickness was within the appropriate range and that there \\nwas a consistent slice interval (with tolerance of ±0.2mm).  \\n \\nGround truth interpretations \\nGround truth interpretations were performed by up to three ABR-certified neuroradiologists. They answered whether the relevant finding \\nwas “Present” or “Absent”. The definition for mass effect was “mass effect as evidenced by effacement of ventricles, basal ci sterns or ',\n",
       " '\\n--- Page4 ---\\n 3 \\n cerebral sulci, midline shift, or brain herniation (e.g., to nsillar herniation or uncal herniation)”. The definition of vasogenic edema was \\n“deep white matter hypodensity extending into subcortical white matter”. The neuroradiologists also answered whether a “paren chymal \\nabnormality including ischemia / mass / cyst / encephalomalacia” was present. They provided their interpretations independently, without \\naccess to the original radiology reports and in different worklist orders. They used the same image visualization software and annotation \\nsystem as was used in the image quality review. They had access to the entire CT head case (i.e., were not restricted to the series selected \\nfor model inference). For determining consensus interpretations for the presence of mass effect or vasogenic edema, a “2+1” s trategy was \\nused: the first two neuroradiologists interpreted every case and a third neuroradiologist then interpreted cases with discrepant \\ninterpretations. A parenchymal abnormality was considered present if either of the first two neuroradiologists annotated it as present; the \\nthird neuroradiologist was not asked about its presence. \\n \\nModel inference \\nThe evaluated AI model was version 3.1.0 of the Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma device. It is the same AI model used by the \\nAnnalise Enterprise (CTB module) device, which is commercially available in some non-US markets and whose development has been \\npreviously described.9 In brief, it consists of an ensemble of five neural networks with three heads: one for classification, one for left-right \\nlocalization and one for segmentation. It can identify 130 different radiological findings and was trained on over 200,000 CT head cases, \\nwhich were each labelled by at least three radiologists. These training cases came from 8 different scanner manufacturers and over 90 \\ndifferent scanner models. The training cases were completely independent of the cases used for this standalone model performance study. \\nThe Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma device only provides binary classification outputs about the identification of findings, which \\nis consistent with FDA regulations for CADt devices. The model was installed at MGB for use in this study and received only the DICOM-\\nformatted CT head cases. It outputted a classification score between 0 and 1 for mass effect and vasogenic edema. A binary output for \\nthese findings could be derived using prespecified operating points. As part of model inference, the device contains multiple filters to look \\nat attributes of the series to be interpreted to ensure the model does not perform inference on unsuitable images; in these situations, the \\ndevice does not p roduce an output and is referred to as “unsuccessful model inference” within this study. While not part of the current \\nstudy, internal bench testing indicated a model turn-around time of 81.6 seconds (95% CI: 80.3 to 82.9 seconds).10, 11 \\n \\nStatistical analysis \\nThe statistical analysis was performed in R (version 4.0.2) on the full analysis set. The predefined endpoints included the areas under the \\nreceiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the identification of mass effect and vasogenic edema for each of thin and thick series. \\nThe AUCs were calculated using the consensus annotations and the classification scores from the AI model. The prespecified endpoints \\nalso included the sensitivity and specificity at predetermined operating points; this paper reports the performance at operating points that \\nhave received FDA clearance. They were calculated by comparing the binary model output at each operating point with the consensus \\nannotations (i.e., by calculating the number of true positive, false negative, true negative and false positive cases).  \\nThe positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated as exploratory analyses at an assumed \\nprevalence of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20. The sensitivities and specificities were calculated as exploratory analyses for the subgroups of \\npresence or absence of a parenchymal abnormality. The AUCs, sensitivities and specificities were calculated as exploratory analyses for \\nthe subgroups of sex, age, ethnicity, race and CT scanner manufacturer. These parameters were derived from clinical databases or DICOM \\nfields for each radiology case. Any missing data were treated a s “Unknown” or “Unavailable” and no data were imputed.  \\nAll CIs were calculated using bootstrapped intervals with 2,000 resamples. The sample sizes for each of the findings were powered based \\non preliminary model results at a balanced operating point to ensure the lower bound of the 95% CI for sensitivity was >80% and for \\nspecificity was >80%.  \\n \\nRESULTS \\nMass effect \\nA cohort of 818 CT head cases were selected for the mass effect cohort (Figure 1). This cohort resulted in 650 thin series and 816 thick \\nseries for which the model could be evaluated. \\n \\nThin series \\nThe model successfully performed inference on 632 (97.2%) thin series.

For mass effect, the AI device achieved AUC 0.987 on thin series and AUC 0.983 on thick series. For vasogenic edema, it \\nachieved AUC 0.980 on thin series and AUC 0.988 on thick series. These AUCs, as well as the lower bounds of their 95% CIs, are in \\nexcess of the benchmark AUC of 0.95 that the FDA uses for CADt devices cleared under the QFM product code.15 Both devices also had \\noperating points that corresponded to sensitivity and specificity of at least 89.8%. These sensitivities and specificities, as well as the lower \\nbounds of their 95% CIs, are in excess of the benchmark sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 80% that the FDA commonly uses for CADt \\ndevices cleared under the QAS product code (which was the product code through which these two findings were cleared).10, 11, 16  \\nThe proposed benefit of CADt devices is that they are “intended to aid in prioritization and triage of radiological medical images”17 such \\nthat clinicians will be aware of abnormal studies sooner and can commence subsequent management steps. There are two other CADt \\ndevices that the FDA has approved for the identification of mass effect. The NinesAI device detects mass effect with sensitivity 96.4% \\nand specificity 91.1%.7 The qER device detects mass effect with sensitivity 96.39% and specificity 96.00%, and midline shift with \\nsensitivity 97.34% and specificity 95.36%.6 The current results are consistent, while noting that the cohorts for the assessment of each \\nalgorithm are different and therefore prevent direct comparison. \\nOne of the ongoing challenges with CADt devices cleared by the FDA is that the regulation states “device does not mark, highl ight, or \\ndirect users' attention to a specific location in the original image”.17 This assessment was therefore based on only the binary identification \\nof mass effect or vasogenic edema, and did not incorporate a localization or segmentation analysis. As we have described previously, a \\nlocalization output including a segmentation or heat-map could assist with explainability by demonstrating what the model has identified \\nespecially when a user suspects the algorithm has falsely identified a finding (i.e., a false positive case).12, 18, 19 The growing number of \\nhead CT findings that can be identified by CADt devices paves the way for application of AI in radiology to use cases requiring broader \\nidentification of findings such as report writing. \",\n",
       " '\\n--- Page6 ---\\n 5 \\n This device demonstrated robust performance across sex, age, ethnicity, race and manufacturer subgroups. It achieved a sensitivity and \\nspecificity of at least 80% whenever there were at least 8 cases within a subgroup. This performance suggests that the device is \\ngeneralizable for different patient demographics and technical parameters. The device will, however, encounter new scenarios when being \\nused in the clinical environment and its ongoing performance should continue to be monitored. The device reassuringly also appeared to \\ndifferentiate between an underlying parenchymal abnormality and mass effect or vasogenic edema, as suggested by its ability to maintain \\na specificity greater than 80% even when a parenchymal abnormality was present. \\nAs we have described for similar standalone model performance assessments, a key limitation of this study is that it is retrospective and \\noutside of the clinical workflow.12, 18 It therefore establishes the accuracy of the model in identifying mass effect and vasogenic edema but \\ndoes not assess its impact on the clinical workflow including for benefit on patient outcomes. We view this initial step as a prerequisite to \\nensure that the device has the potential to provide clinical benefit. Further evaluation will be required to prove such a benefit. \\n \\nCONCLUSIONS \\nThis standalone model performance assessment investigated the ability of an AI device to identify mass effect and vasogenic edema on \\nhead CT. It demonstrated performance that exceeded the FDA benchmarks for CADt devices. Its use could lead to improved care and \\noutcomes for patients with these findings. \\n \\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \\nThe authors thank the broader Mass General Brigham Data Science Office and Annalise- AI teams for their assistance with this project. \\nThis study was funded by Annalise-AI.
