510(k) Summary
1. Description of the Device
Synapse 3D Base Tools (V7.0) (this submission) is updated software of previously-cleared
Synapse 3D Base Tools (V6.6) (cleared by CDRH via K221677 on 11/10/2022).

The 3D image analysis software Synapse 3D Base Tools (V7.0) is medical application
software running on Windows server/client configuration installed on commercial
general-purpose Windows-compatible computers. It offers software tools which can be used by
trained professionals to interpret medical images obtained from various medical devices, to
create reports, or to develop treatment plans.

Synapse 3D Base Tools is connected through DICOM standard to medical devices such as CT,
MR, CR, US, NM, PT, XA, etc. and to a PACS system storing data generated by these medical
devices, and it retrieves image data via network communications based on the DICOM
standard. The retrieved image data are stored on the local disk managed by Synapse 3D Base
Tools (V7.0), and the associated image-related information of the image data is registered in its
database and is used for display, image processing, analysis, etc. Images newly created by
Synapse 3D Base Tools (V7.0) not only can be displayed on a display, but also can be printed
on a hardcopy using a DICOM printer or a Windows printer.

Synapse 3D Base Tools (V7.0) is a basic software module that works with other cleared
clinical applications, including Synapse 3D Cardiac Tools (K200973), Synapse 3D Perfusion
Analysis (K162287), Synapse 3D Lung and Abdomen Analysis (K130542), Synapse 3D Liver
and Kidney Analysis (K142521), Synapse 3D Nodule Analysis (K120679), Synapse 3D
Colon Analysis (K123566), Synapse 3D Tensor Analysis (K141514) and Synapse 3D Blood
Flow Analysis (K191544). All these software modules consist of the Synapse 3D product
family.

Synapse 3D Base Tools can be integrated with Fujifilm’s Synapse PACS, and can be used as a
part of a Synapse system. Synapse 3D Base Tools also can be integrated with Fujifilm’s Synapse
Cardiovascular for cardiology purposes.
