Indications for Use (Describe)

Velacur is intended to provide estimates of tissue stiffness generated from shear wave speed measurements (40-70 Hz),
ultrasound attenuation and Velacur Determined Fat Fraction (VDFF). The Velacur Determined Fat Fraction combines
ultrasound attenuation and backscatter coefficient measurements. The device is indicated to non-invasively determine
liver tissue stiffness, attenuation, and Velacur Determined Fat Fraction. VDFF is not intended to be used in pediatric
patients. These are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical indicators in order to aid in clinical management of
patients with liver diseases, including hepatic steatosis.

The device is intended to be used in a clinical setting and by trained medical professionals.

Predicate Device

Velacur (K232459) manufactured by Sonic Incytes Medical Corp., Vancouver, Canada, and
cleared on September 12, 2023.

Reference device: Siemens Acuson Sequoia (K183575) cleared on March 20, 2019.
Device Description

The device that is the subject of this submission is the same one cleared under K232459,
Velacur.

Velacur is a portable device intended to non-invasively measure the stiffness and attenuation of
the liver via measurement of liver tissue shear modulus and ultrasound attenuation. This is done
by measuring the wavelength or wave speed of mechanically created shear waves within the
organ of the patient. Attenuation is measured directly via the loss in power of the ultrasound
beam.

The device is designed to be used at the point of care, in clinics and hospitals. The device is
used by a medical profession, an employee of the clinic/hospital. The activation unit is placed
under the patient, while lying supine on an exam bed. The activation unit vibrates at frequencies
40, 50, and 60 Hz causing shear waves within the liver of the patient. The ultrasound
transducer is placed on the patient’s skin, over the intercostal space, and is used to take

Model: U-1005 @ Soniclincytes Section 5 -2

volumetric scans of the liver while shear waves are occurring. The device includes two
algorithms designed to help users detect good quality shear waves and identify liver tissue.
From the scan data, the device calculates tissue stiffness and attenuation.

Minor hardware and software changes were made to the device. The organ guide (cleared in
K223287) was also extended to add more optional overlays on top of the liver overlay to help
with optimizing the scan and training users to obtain adequate images. The significant change is
the addition of a new output measure for Velacur, an ultrasound derived fat fraction (VDFF).

Intended Use! Indication for Use

Velacur is intended to provide estimates of tissue stiffness generated from shear wave speed
measurements (40-70 Hz), ultrasound attenuation and Velacur Determined Fat Fraction
(VDFF). The Velacur Determined Fat Fraction combines ultrasound attenuation and backscatter
coefficient measurements. The device is indicated to non-invasively determine liver tissue
stiffness, attenuation, and Velacur Determined Fat Fraction. VDFF is not intended to be used in
pediatric patients. These are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical indicators in
order to aid in clinical management of patients with liver diseases, including hepatic steatosis.

The device is intended to be used in a clinical setting and by trained medical professionals.
Substantial Equivalence

The candidate device has the same intended use and indications for use as the predicate
device in that the outputs are meant to be used in conjunction with other clinical indicators in
order to aid in clinical management of patients with liver diseases.

The technology used in the candidate and predicate device is based on ultrasound to measure
elastography and attenuation (ACE). The systems measure the same physical variables, tissue
stiffness and ultrasound attenuation, and therefore the devices are substantially equivalent in
their basic technology.

Sonic Incytes has introduced a third Velacur output, the Velacur Determined Fat Fraction
(VDFF), in addition to the elasticity and ACE output. The Siemens Sequoia Ultrasonically
Derived Fat Fraction (UDFF) was used as the reference device for this output measure. The
same as UDFF, the VDFF algorithm combines ultrasound attenuation measurements and a
computed backscatter coefficient (BSC). The same as UDFF, MRI proton density fat fraction
was used as the ground truth for validation. The performance testing acceptance criteria were
based on UDFF testing and results.

The candidate device with the described changes does not raise any new issues of safety or
effectiveness.

Performance Data
The following testing was performed:

e Performance verification testing of the Velacur Determined Fat Fraction output
e Backscatter testing on phantoms, using phantoms with known backscatter parameters
e Sweep guidance tool testing

Validation of Velacur Determined Fat Fraction algorithm (VDFF)

Velacur Determined Fat Fraction was tested in a cohort of patients with both Velacur and MRI-
PDFF scans. 112 patients from 4 sites were used in for parameter fitting (training) and 70 new
patients from 3 separate sites (with different Velacur operators) were used for the final
validation. All MRI scans were assessed to create the final measurement.

Acceptance criteria were based on the correlation coefficient (r) between VDFF and MRI-PDFF,
and the detection of 5% steatosis. Demographic distribution of the patients is summarized
below:

Machine Learning Validation for Organ Guide Extension

The Organ Guide was extended to include surrounding organs and features.
Dice Coefficient and pixel accuracy were used for characterization and validation of the
performance of the organ guide extension. The acceptance criteria were:

o Dice Coefficient > 0.7

o Pixel accuracy > 80%
More than 5,000 patient images were used for training. Training data was collected
during clinical trials of volunteers and patients with chronic liver disease of all severities.
Data was collected from sites across the US and Canada.
Evaluation was completed on more than 800 images from 21 patients.
Volunteers and patients were recruited from all genders, ages between 18-70 and all
ethnicities, with from 33-50% minority representation.
Evaluation data was collected from volunteers and patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. All patients were recruited from hepatology
clinics and represent a group with more severe liver disease than the general public.
All data was collected using the Velacur system.
Ground truth was established using manual image segmentation by experts in the field
of sonography and/or ultrasound elastography.
Data used in the validation of the algorithm performance was obtained from separate
patients, sites and collected by different users than the data used for training in order to
ensure data independence.
