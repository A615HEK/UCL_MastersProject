6. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

DEEPECHO is a cloud-based standalone software as a medical device (SaMD) that helps
qualified healthcare professionals in the assessment of obstetrical images.

The device is intended for use by qualified and appropriately trained healthcare professionals,
including but not limited to: radiologists, obstetricians, sonographers, maternal and fetal
medicine specialists, obstetricians and gynecologists, as well as fetal surgeons. The device's
application is intended for pregnant patients aged 18 years and older between the 14" and the
41“ weeks of pregnancy.

DEEPECHO takes as an input either Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
(DICOM) images or a live fetal ultrasound image streaming from ultrasound scanners. When
DEEPECHO is in use, it allows healthcare professionals to browse fetal ultrasound images,
identify views (cephalic, abdominal, and femoral) and suggest a placement for calipers on fetal
ultrasound images of the identified views and compute biometrical measurements of the latter
(HC (Head Circumference), BPD (Bi-parietal Diameter), FL (Femur Length), AC (Abdominal
Circumference), GA (Gestational Age), EFW (Estimated Fetal Weight)).

When DEEPECHO is used during real time (i.e., during the examination) the device receives
real-time image streaming from an ultrasound machine and can be used to identify views
(cephalic, abdominal, and femoral), and suggests a placement for calipers. These Ultrasound
images are acquired using an HDMI cable that is plugged into the local device (e.g., computer,
tablet) running DEEPECHO, through an HDMI to USB Video Capture. Note that the device
cannot compute measurements in real time as the real time data received from the ultrasound
machine is a live stream video and not in a DICOM format. DICOM data is necessary to
automatically compute biometrical measurements.

Additionally, DEEPECHO handles patient and exam management by allowing healthcare
professionals to create, update, and archive records. When DICOM files are uploaded post-
examination, the software either links the exam to an existing patient record or automatically
generates a new one from the DICOM files’ metadata. It enables healthcare professionals to
track a patient's history, including exams, reports, and all information directly inputted to the
platform.

7. INDICATIONS FOR USE

DEEPECHO is intended to analyze fetal ultrasound images and clips using machine learning
techniques to detect standard biometry views. Upon views detection, DEEPECHO assists in
measurements computation of fetal biometric parameters (i.e., head circumference, abdominal
circumference, femur length, and bi-parietal diameter).

The device is intended for use by qualified and appropriately trained healthcare professionals as
a concurrent reading and measuring aid during the acquisition and interpretation of fetal
ultrasound images of patients aged 18 years or older done between the 14" and the 41° weeks of
pregnancy.

DEEPECHO and predicate and reference devices are intended to be used by trained healthcare
providers in the analysis of fetal ultrasound images. The devices all use artificial intelligence
(AD) and machine learning algorithms to assist healthcare professionals in the interpretation and
analysis of these images.

Both DEEPECHO and Sonio Detect are capable of automatically detecting various standard
views during fetal ultrasound examinations. The views identified by DEEPECHO are a subset of
the views identified by Sonio Detect. Both systems also automatically identify standard fetal
ultrasound views.

DEEPECHO and Sonio Detect both generate detailed reports based on the analysis of fetal
ultrasound images.

Sonio Detect operates as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that requires installation of edge
software on a server connected to the same network as the ultrasound machine. In contrast,
DEEPECHO is a cloud-based standalone software that can be accessed from various devices,
such as laptops, tablets, or desktops, without the need for local server installation. This difference
does not raise different types of safety or effectiveness questions, as both deployment methods
are commonly used in medical device software.

DEEPECHO differs from Sonio Detect in that it also computes a full set of biometric
measurements—FL, AC, BPD, HC, EFW and EGA—which are included directly in its generated
report; Sonio Detect does not compute any biometric measurements. In addition, DEEPECHO
does not incorporate substructure detection or quality-criteria verification, both of which are
provided by Sonio Detect. The Samsung Biometry Assist feature (the secondary reference
device) likewise computes biometric measurements but does not automatically derive GA or
EFW—users must select one of several well-established formulas to calculate those metrics.

9. SUMMARY OF NON-CLINICAL PERFORMANCE TESTING
Software

Software was evaluated for a basic documentation level as recommended in the 2023 FDA
guidance document Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions and
software verification and validation data was performed.

Performance Testing

DeepEcho performed a stand-alone assessment comparing the performance of the DEEPECHO
software to a ground truth of annotations by qualified experts.

Sample Size and Data Source

The bench testing dataset consisted of 417 ultrasound studies collected from 15 clinical sites
across the United States, Mexico, and Morocco. Following the application of predefined
exclusion criteria, including corrupted files and incomplete views, the final analysis population
included 397 subjects, contributing a total of 23,544 de-identified 2D grayscale ultrasound
images. Clinical sites included both tertiary maternal-fetal medicine practices and community-
based health settings.

Relationship Between Patients and Images

Each subject contributed multiple images, including standard fetal biometry planes (biparietal
diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length) and non-standard views.
Each image was independently reviewed by three ARDMS-certified sonographers with a
minimum of five years of clinical ultrasound experience.

Demographics

The population included subjects with a mean maternal age of 29.4 years (range: 15—56) and a
mean BMI of 26.8 (range: 17.5—52.5). The racial and ethnic distribution was as follows: 44%
White non-Hispanic, 24% Hispanic/Latino, 13.3% Black non-Hispanic, 12.3% Asian, 4.5%
Pacific Islander, and 1.9% American Indian or Alaskan Native.

Ultrasound Equipment and Protocols

DEEPECHO was only validated with the following ultrasound systems: Butterfly iQ3, GE
Voluson (S8, $10, E6), Clarius HD3, and Philips [U22 and HD7. Image acquisition occurred
during second and third trimester exams. All data were stored in DICOM, MP4 and PNG
formats. Images from first trimester exams, Doppler imaging, and 3D acquisitions were
excluded. No standardized acquisition protocol was enforced across sites.

Truthing Process (Reference Standard Derivation)

All images were annotated using the CVAT platform by three independent ARDMS-certified
sonographers with at least five years of experience. For continuous measurement endpoints, the
ground truth was calculated as the arithmetic mean of three independent caliper placements. For
classification endpoints, ground truth was based on unanimous agreement across reviewers.
Inter-reader agreement for continuous outcomes exceeded ICC > 0.99.

Dataset Independence

Page 6 of 10
510(k) Summary — K242594

No training data, patients, or clinical sites overlapped with the test dataset. Training data were
obtained from two Roshan MFM clinics in New York City and selected sites in Morocco. Test
data were acquired from separate sites in the United States, Mexico, and Morocco, including
Seattle (WA), Garden City (NY), Union (NJ), Honesdale (PA), Chiapas (Mexico), and
Casablanca (Morocco).

Summary Test Results
There were 6 primary endpoints in the DEEPECHO trial comparing DEEPECHO to ground truth
measurements:
1. Comparison of femur length
Comparison of head circumference
Comparison of abdominal circumference

Comparison of biparietal diameter

Primary endpoints #5 and #6 evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of DEEPECHO in detecting
anatomical views. To account for intra-subject correlation due to multiple observations per
subject, a blockwise bootstrap method was used, with the subject as the resampling unit. The
resulting point estimates reflect sample proportions, and the corresponding two-sided 95%
confidence intervals were derived using this non-parametric approach.

*Confidence intervals were calculated using blocked bootstrapping

Worst-case analysis

A worst-case analysis was performed by imputing missing data as failures, based on the average
number of observations per subject. After applying this conservative approach, the sensitivity
and specificity for each anatomical view were recalculated. For the abdominal view, sensitivity
was 82.7% (95% CI: 79.0%-85.8%) and specificity was 92.1% (95% CI: 91.4%—92.5%). For the
cephalic view, sensitivity was 93.4% (95% CI: 91.5%-94.8%) and specificity was 90.2% (95%
CI: 89.4%-90.6%). For the femoral view, sensitivity was 87.6% (95% CI: 83.5%-—90.2%) and
specificity was 92.7% (95% CI: 91.9%—-93.2%).

Subgroup Analysis

Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess performance of view identification across maternal
age, gestational age, BMI, racial/ethnic groups, acquisition sites, ultrasound system
manufacturers, image types, image resolution, and operator image quality. For the cephalic
view, both sensitivity and specificity remained high across all subgroups, with sensitivity
typically above 95% and specificity above 93%. For the femoral view, sensitivity was also
robust, typically exceeding 90%, and specificity remained above 95% across subgroups. In cases
where point estimates were lower, this was primarily attributable to small denominators.
Importantly, analyses stratified by ultrasound system type, image quality, and operator-assessed
image quality showed no evidence of performance degradation.
