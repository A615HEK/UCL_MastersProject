4 Device description

FETOLY-HEART is a software that aims at helping sonographers, obstetricians, radiologists, maternal-fetal
medicine specialists, and pediatric cardiologists (designated as healthcare professionals i.e. HCPs) to
perform fetal ultrasound examinations of the fetal heart in real-time. FETOLY-HEART can be used by HCPs
during fetal ultrasound examinations in the second and third trimesters (gestational age window: from 17
to 40 weeks). The software is intended to assist HCPs in the completeness assessment of the fetal heart
ultrasound examination in accordance with national and international guidelines.

To utilize FETOLY-HEART, the software needs to be installed on a hardware device which is connected to
an Ultrasound Machine through an HDMI connection. The software receives ultrasound images captured
by the connected Ultrasound Machine in real-time. The software’s frozen deep learning algorithm, which
was trained by supervised learning, analyzes images of this ultrasound image stream to detect heart views
and quality criteria within those views. The software provides the following user-accessible
information:

e Examination completeness: the software displays in real-time which heart views and quality
criteria are verified by the software during the examination. /t is the main and principal output
of the FETOLY-HEART device. The verified heart views and quality criteria are accessible by
clinicians at any moment of the ultrasound examination, in real-time.

e Completeness illustration: the software selects an image subset that illustrates the verified views
and quality criteria. These images can be reviewed by clinicians to verify the views and criteria’s
presence. This is a secondary output of the FETOLY-HEART device. Optionally, clinicians can
display detected quality criteria localization on selected images.

Table 1. List of 52 quality criteria defining the quality of the 5 views recommended by the International Society of
Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology for the foetal heart screening of 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy.
Abbreviations from this table are corresponding to the abbreviations used within the software.

International and national guidelines! recommend 5 foetal cardiac views for routine ultrasound
examination of 2nd and 3rd trimesters: (A) Abdomen view, (B) Four chamber view, (C) Left Ventricular
Outflow Tract view, (D) Right Ventricular Outflow Tract view, (E) Three vessels view. The quality of these
5 heart views depends on the presence of 52 anatomical quality criteria within the views (Table 1). Thus,
an examination can be defined as complete when all 5 heart views and their quality criteria are obtained
by the HCP.

4.2 Functionality 1: completeness overview

The software assesses the completeness of the foetal ultrasound examination. It verifies whether all the
information corresponding to the recommended guidelines for the foetal heart examination has been
acquired. This information corresponds to the presence of 5 main foetal cardiac views and 52 quality
criteria, detailed in the above section, allowing for compliance in cardiac screening.

4,3 Functionality 2: completeness illustration

This functionality was developed to enhance the security of the completeness evaluation which is done
by the first module. It enables clinicians to verify the examination completeness overview, i.e. verified
views and quality criteria by the software through the gallery page of the software interface. Operating
continuously, it evaluates each image processed by the first module in real-time, retaining an image set
as visual evidence of the verified heart views and quality criteria up to that moment.

FETOLY-HEART does not aim to select the ‘best’ or of ‘high’ diagnostic quality according to a given
qualitative scale. Rather, FETOLY-HEART aims to select images illustrating the examination quantitative
completeness in terms of verified views and quality criteria.

5 Indications for use

FETOLY-HEART is intended to analyse fetal ultrasound images and clips using machine learning techniques
to automatically detect heart views and quality criteria within the views. The device is intended for use as
a concurrent reading aid during the acquisition and interpretation of fetal ultrasound images.

FETOLY-HEART is indicated for use during routine fetal heart examination of 2nd and 3rd trimester
pregnancy (gestational age: from 17 to 40 weeks).

FETOLY-HEART uses a machine learning (ML) algorithm for detection of heart views and quality criteria
within these views in ultrasound images. Modifications to FETOLY-HEART will be made in accordance with
the guiding principles on predetermined change control plans (PCCP) for machine learning-enabled
medical devices. This PCCP provides a description of the device’s planned modifications, and those
modifications will be triggered and implemented in a controlled manner that ensures the continued safety
and efficacy on the performance testing dataset, mitigating risks associated with changes to the ML model
to not adversely impact the device’s performance, safety, or effectiveness associated with its indications
for use, and an impact assessment of the planned modifications.

In accordance with the PCCP, all algorithm modifications will be adequately trained, tuned, and locked
prior to release of the software with the modified ML model. The PCCP does not include the
implementation of adaptive algorithms that will continuously learn in the field. Implemented
modifications to the FETOLY-HEART algorithm will be communicated to users via the software update
notifications and through updated labelling. The modifications outlined in the PCCP are summarized in
the table below. The PCCP in the subject device with the proposed modifications related to modifying
model training hyperparameters, additional retraining with new training and validation datasets
collected, and addition/removal of heart quality criteria do not raise different questions of safety and
effectiveness from the predicate device (see table below).

7.2 FETOLY-HEART performance study

Diagnoly conducted a standalone performance testing on a dataset of 2,288 fetal ultrasound images
across 480 patient cases, including full examination still images, cardiac clip frames and full examination
video frames from 7 clinical sites in the United States and France. These sites and cases are representative
of the intended use population. This testing dataset originated from distinct clinical sites from which the
data used during model development (training/validation) was sourced, ensuring testing independence.

The results of the standalone performance testing demonstrate that FETOLY-HEART automatically detects
fetal heart ultrasound views with a sensitivity 2 85% (acceptance criterion) and specificity = 85%
(acceptance criterion), detects quality criteria within heart views with a sensitivity 2 90% (acceptance
criterion) and a specificity > 90% (acceptance criterion), and localizes bounding boxes of quality criteria
with a mean intersection over union (loU) of 2 50% (acceptance criterion). Sensitivity and specificity were
evaluated individually for each view, and the performance goal to exceed 85% as the lower bound of the
corresponding 95% Confidence Interval (Cl) was met. The Cl was estimated using bootstrap resampling at
the subject level based on 1,000 samples, with traditional bootstrap Cl confidence limits derived as the
2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of bootstrap estimates. The results are summarized in the
tables below:

The performance validation dataset included the following clinical subgroups: maternal age, gestational
age, territory, BMI, scanner manufacturer, heart abnormality. It also comprised races and ethnicities and
various clinical sites, ensuring representation across the intended use population. Image digital quality
(bad, average, good) and image type (still image from entire examination, cardiac clip frame, full
examination frame) were identified as potential confounders and controlled for. Performance metrics
were analyzed for each subgroup and confounder to validate the model’s robustness and generalizability.
The subgroups distribution is summarized in the table below:

Patient cases were retrospectively collected in reverse chronological order until at least 20 patient files
per subgroup and an overall of 275 patient files were reached. To limit correlation of the images used for
evaluation, one image maximum per view per patient case was selected by categorizing 12,934 images
from the patient cases into heart views and randomly picking one image maximum per view, resulting in
a total of 2,288 images.

A 2+1 ground truth procedure was used to obtain the reference standard of the dataset. Six annotators
(3 sonographers and 3 OB/GYN doctors) were paired and assigned uniformly distributed batches of
images. The attribution was randomized so that each pair treated images belonging to various subgroups.
Each image was annotated by a pair of annotators as belonging to one of 6 views. Images with annotator
agreement were considered ground truth. Images in which the pair of annotators disagreed were
reviewed by an adjudicator, who made the final decision.

For quality criteria classification and localization, each image was annotated by a pair of annotators who
drew bounding boxes on present criteria. If their boxes had at least 50% overlap, their coordinates were
averaged to form the ground truth. If the overlap was lower or there was a disagreement on the criterion
presence, an adjudicator reviewed the boxes. The final decision regarding the presence was based on
majority consensus among the adjudicator and annotators. The final decision for the criteria localization
was based on the adjudicator’s decision to either keep one of the annotator’s boxes or draw a new one.

The results of verification and performance testing demonstrate the safe and effective use of FETOLY-
HEART.

8 Clinical performance data

Not applicable.

9 Conclusion from non-clinical tests

FETOLY-HEART intended users, clinical outcome and clinical applications are similar to those of the
predicate device Sonio Detect. The technological characteristics differences identified and discussed in
Section VI are covered by a reference device, the SonoLystLive view suggestion feature within the Voluson
Expert Series 22/20/18 (K220358), and do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness of the
device.

Furthermore, results of successful verification and validation activities and additional performance testing
do not raise any new issue regarding the safety and effectiveness of the device. FETOLY-HEART is therefore
substantially equivalent to its predicate device Sonio Detect (K240406).
