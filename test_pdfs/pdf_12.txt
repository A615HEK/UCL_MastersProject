6 Summary of Non-Clinical Testing

The subject device has undergone design reviews, risk analyses, and verification and validation testing, to
ensure its safety and effectiveness. The subject device has been assessed using well-established methods to
validate that is substantial equivalent to the predicate device.

6.1 Machine Learning features

The machine-learning features were trained and tested using DICOM data from several clinical sites from
multiple countries. The DICOM data was acquired using a variety of CT/MRI scanners and scanner protocols
from different manufacturers.

This DICOM data was anonymized by the hospitals before being sent to us, in compliance with the European
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This anonymization process prevented including personal
patient information such as gender, age, or ethnicity.

This DICOM dataset includes a diverse range of atrial and ventricular conditions. The Left Ventricle (LV)
includes ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies such as left ventricular hypertrophy and dilated
cardiomyopathy, as well as other cardiac conditions like premature ventricular contractions. The Left Atrium
(LA), includes a diverse range of conditions and presentations, from relatively healthy atrial tissue to various
forms of atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent, and recurrent cases), other atrial

pathologies such as atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia, and structural heart diseases impacting left atrial
function.

6.1.1 Training

For each machine learning feature, the training dataset has been obtained from the initial DICOM dataset,
according to the image modality and the target structure. All DICOM images are from European hospitals.
The details of the training dataset for each machine learning feature are summarized in the table below.

The DICOM dataset has been annotated identifying the target structures. The annotation of the data was
generated initially by the hospitals’ clinical teams and revised by Adas3D Medical’s Clinical Team. The Adas3D
Medical’s Clinical Team consists of highly experienced individuals with knowledge of cardiac anatomy,
interpretation of MRI and CT volumes, and the use of ADAS 3D.

6.1.2 Performance testing

The performance testing for each machine learning feature was performed using a subset of the initial DICOM
dataset, that was selected according to the target structure, the image modality, the country, and the scan
manufacturer. Each testing dataset has been selected from hospitals not used in any stage of algorithm
development, including training. The details of each testing dataset are summarized in the table below.

Ground truth annotations were generated using the manual tools of the FDA-cleared ADAS 3D software by
two clinical experts independent of the clinical experts who established the ground truth of the training

dataset.

The performance metrics and the acceptance criteria for each target structure are based on a review of state-

of-the-art algorithms. Performance testing follows a non-inferiority approach, with a predefined non-

inferiority margin. The primary goal of ADAS 3D is to provide a preliminary initialization of the target

structure, which would then be subject to further refinement by the user. This non-inferiority approach

confirms that the performance aligns with the average performance benchmarks reported in the field.

The following metrics have been used to define the acceptance criteria:

@ MSD: Mean Surface Distance.

e@ HD: Hausdorff Distance.

e MDS: Mean Difference in Shifts computes the slice alignment error between two 2D MRI images. It
is computed as the mean of the shifts in x and y dimensions for all slices.

APD: The Average Perpendicular Distance measures the average distance (in mm) of all
corresponding contour points between two contours. A low APD value means that the two contours
match closely.

DC: Dice Metric.

Color agreement (CA), Color disagreement by one color (CD1), and Color disagreement by two colors
or more (CD2): These three metrics are defined in the paper: Valles-Colomer, A., Rubio Forcada, B.,

Four tests did not meet the non-inferiority criteria. In these four cases, the discrepancies are sub-pixel,
indicating that our algorithm's performance is acceptable given the minimum pixel spacing of the input
images.

A subgroup analysis found that the algorithms’ performance is consistent across US and OUS groups.
6.1.3 Performance testing conclusion

The results of the performance testing confirm that the subject device met all acceptance criteria and
demonstrate that the performance of the machine learning features is in line with the performance of the
predicate device.

7 Conclusion

The comparison of the subject device with the predicate device show that they have substantially equivalent
indications for use, functional and technological characteristics.

Adas3D Medical believes the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device and is as safe
and effective as the predicate device.
