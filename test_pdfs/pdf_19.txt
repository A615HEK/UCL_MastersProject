Indications for Use (Describe)

The uMI Panorama is a diagnostic imaging system that combines two existing imaging modalities
PET and CT. The quantitative distribution information of PET radiopharmaceuticals within the patient
body measured by PET can assist healthcare providers in assessing metabolic and physiological
functions. CT provides diagnostic tomographic anatomical information as well as photon attenuation
information for the scanned region. The accurate registration and fusion of PET and CT images
provides anatomical reference for the findings in the PET images.

This system is intended to be operated by qualified healthcare professionals to assist in the
detection, localization, diagnosis, staging, restaging, treatment planning and treatment response
evaluation for diseases, inflammation, infection and disorders in, but not limited to oncology,
cardiology and neurology. The system maintains independent functionality of the CT device,
allowing for single modality CT diagnostic imaging.

This CT system can be used for low dose CT lung cancer screening for the early detection of lung
nodules that may represent cancer. The screening must be performed within the established
inclusion criteria of programs / protocols that have been approved and published by either a
governmental body or professional medical society.

* Please refer to clinical literature, including the results of the National Lung Screening Trial (N Engl

Device Description:

The proposed device uMI Panorama GS combines a 148 cm axial field of view (FOV)
PET and multi-slice CT system to provide high quality functional and anatomical
images, fast PET/CT imaging and better patient experience. The system includes PET
gantry, CT gantry, patient table, power supply cabinet, console and reconstruction
system, chiller, vital signal module.

The uMI Panorama GS has been previously cleared by FDA via K231572. The
mainly modifications performed on the uMI Panorama GS (K231572) in this
submission are due to the algorithm update of AIIR, the addition of HYPER Iterative,
uExcel DPR, RMC, AIEFOV, Motion Management, CT-less AC, uKinetics,
Retrospective Respiratory-gated Scan, uExcel Unity and uExcel iQC.

Details about the modifications are listed as below:

@ = AIIR, also named Deep IR, has been cleared via K223028 on uCT ALTLAS
Astound (CT subsystem of the predicate device uMI Panorama GS). Deep IR can
reduce image noise and streak artifacts, increase high contrast spatial resolution
and improve low contrast detectability, and it can correspondingly reduce the
dose required for diagnostic CT images. Compared with the previous clearance,
AIIR in this submission changed its deep learning (DL) network from a

variational network to a three-dimension deep convolutional neural network (3D-
DCNN).

@ HYPER Iterative (cleared via K193241), uses a regularized iterative
reconstruction algorithm, which allows for more iterations while keeping the
image noise at an acceptable level by incorporating a noise penalty term into the
objective function.

@ uExcel DPR (also named HYPER AiR, cleared via K210001) incorporates pre-
trained neural networks in the iteration reconstruction process to reduce noise and
improve contrast of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images.

@ RMC, Respiratory Motion Correct (also named uExcel Focus or OncoFocus,
cleared via K232712) is an AI-based algorithm to reduce respiratory motion
artifacts in PET/CT images and at the same time reduce the PET/CT
misalignment.

@ uKinetics (cleared via K232712) is a kinetic modeling toolkit for both indirect
and direct parametric imaging. Compared the previous clearance, uKinetics for
uMI Panorama GS only supports the indirect parametric imaging, in which the
parametric images were generated from post-reconstruction voxel-based fitting of
dynamic PET. The toolkit also supports PBIF template generation and scaling.

@ AIEFOV is an extended field of view algorithm connecting projection data
extrapolation and deep learning. AIEFOV is expected to be used to obtain
improved image quality when scanning objects exceed the CT scan-FOV, such as
bariatric patients or arms-down scan positioning.

@ Motion Management (MM) is a unified solution for addressing the patient motion
related artifacts due to head, torso and respiratory motion. It can execute motion
management algorithms for different regions of interest (ROI) according to the
user-selected commands, eliminating motion-induced blurring of PET images,
removing the PET/CT misalignment introduced AC artifacts, addressing the
PET/CT misalignment in the final image, as well as improving the accuracy of
SUV.

@ CT-less AC is developed with deep learning technology to achieve PET AC
without CT images. The reconstructed PET AC images will be registered to a
user-selected CT images to formulate well matched PET/CT fusion images which
is used for the further analysis. Even the AC was performed without CT, there is
no significant quantitative difference between the final PET image and AC with
CT (CTAC).

@ Retrospective Respiratory-gated Scan (cleared via K232712) utilizes respiratory
signal to visualize the respiratory motion during scan. Data can be reconstructed
with phase-based or amplitude-based binning.

@ uExcel Unity (cleared via K232712) is a visual parameter calculation tool to
achieve accurate SUV normalization with one click. It reduces the impact of
differences in equipment performance, acquisition parameters, reconstruction
parameters and other differences.

@ uExcel iQC (cleared via K232712) is a novel radioactive free automatic QC
solution for the PET system instead of utilizing the systems intrinsic radioactive
properties.

Summary of functionality using deep learning algorithm
> AIEFOV

The training data contains 506476 images covered different patient body sizes and
different scanning positions. All data were manually quality controlled before included
for training.

The performance bench tests include:
- water phantom scan in the center and outside of CT scan-FOV
- patients studies in the center and outside of CT scan-FOV

The acceptance criteria of performance bench tests were:

- AIEFOV shall improve the accuracy of CT value, and improve the accuracy and
uniformity of PET image SUV by performing attenuation correction with CT
generated with AIEFOV algorithm when scanned object exceed CT field of view.

- AI EFOV shall have consistent CT value, and PET image SUV by performing
attenuation correction with CT generated with AIEFOV algorithm when scanned
object does not exceed the CT field of view.

Besides the performance bench tests, a clinical evaluation was also performed. The
clinical test dataset included 9303 images of 13 patients (table 1) at different truncation
situations were scanned in uMI Panorama GS to prove the effectiveness of AI EFOV.
The clinical images were reviewed by two American Board qualified clinical experts
for blind comparison regarding to image Artifacts, homogeneity of same tissue and
diagnostic confidence in PET images.

Sex (male:female) 7:6

* Data were presented as mean + SD (range).

The training dataset used for the training of AIEFOV algorithm was independent of
the dataset used to test the algorithm.

Bench tests showed that performing attenuation correction with AIEFOV can improve
the CT number and the accuracy of SUV, in cases where the scanned object exceeds
the CT field of scan-FOV. Meanwhile, when the scanned object did not exceed the CT
scan-FOV, either AIEFOV or EFOV results in consistent SUV and CT number.
Clinical evaluation concluded the image quality of PET attenuated with AIEFOV
provides sufficient diagnostic confidence.

Based on the bench tests and clinical evaluation, the performing attenuation correction
with AIEFOV CT can improve the accuracy of image SUV, in cases where the scanned
