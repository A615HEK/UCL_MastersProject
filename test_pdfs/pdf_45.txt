Summary of the Machine Learning Algorithm
@ SparkCo

SparkCo (Spark artifact Correction) is an algorithm that can detect and correct spark
artifacts in MRI images, which will help to restore spark-free image for clinical
review when encountering spark artifacts on MRI images.

The spark detection module of SparkCo is based on the AI algorithm, however, it
won’t change the image directly, and it only provides the K-space location of spark
points. Then, the spark correction module based on traditional parallel imaging

Page 9 of 14
 

Shanghai United Imaging Healthcare Co., Ltd. a
Tel: +86 (21) 67076888 Fax: +86 (21) 67076889 UNITED

www.united-imaging.com IMAGING

reconstruction algorithm will utilize the spark detection results to remove spark
points and restore the full-sampled K-space. Through this two-step process, SparkCo
can correct spark artifacts and restore the spark-free image.

The training dataset for the AI module in SparkCo was generated by simulating spark
artifacts from spark-free raw data. The spark-free raw data comprises 61 cases
collected from 10 volunteers across various body parts and MRI sequences. From
this data, a total of 24,866 spark slices, along with the corresponding ground truth
(i.e., the location of spark points), were generated for training. Additionally, 159
spark slices were generated as the simulated spark testing dataset.

The real-world spark raw data consists of 59 cases collected from 15 patients, serving
as the independent testing dataset, which does not overlap with the training dataset.
The demographic distribution of this testing dataset is presented in Table 4. And this
testing dataset were acquired by using uMR 1.5T and uMR 3T scanners, which cover
representative protocols in clinical practice such as T1, T2, and PD with and without
fat saturation. Details of acquisition from various body parts are outlined in Table 5.

Remark: The performance of SparkCo is irrelevant with human ethnicity. The spark
detection module of SparkCo is designed to classify and locate the spark signals with
abnormally high amplitude in the K-space data. These spark signals exhibit similar
characteristics across different human ethnicity, so no testing was conducted on other
human ethnicity.

A total of 90 images from 28 patients were used as the test data. For each patient, it
had the native tl map data and post tl map data.

Acceptance Criteria

The validation type and acceptance criteria is shown in the Table 7 below.

Passing rate

 

 

To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, the subjective evaluation
method was used. The segmentation result of each case was obtained with
the algorithm, and the segmentation mask was evaluated with the following
criteria. The test pass criteria was: no failure cases, satisfaction rate
S/(S+A+F) exceeding 95%.

The criteria is as follows:

. Satisfied (S): the segmentation myocardial boundary adheres to the
myocardial boundary and blood pool ROI is within the blood pool excluding
the papillary muscles.

. Acceptable (A): These are small missing or redundant areas in the
myocardial segmentation but not obviously and the blood pool ROI is within
the blood pool excluding the papillary muscles.

. Fail (F): The myocardial mask does not adhere to the myocardial
boundary or the blood pool ROI is not within the blood pool, or the blood
pool ROI contains papillary muscles.

Testing & Training Data Independence
The training data used for the training of the cardiac ventricular segmentation
algorithm is independent of the data used to test the algorithm.

Summary

The features described in this premarket submission are supported with the results of
the testing mentioned above, the uMR Omega was found to have a safety and
effectiveness profile that is similar to the predicate device.

9. Conclusion

Based on the comparison and analysis above, the proposed device has similar
indications for use, performance, safety equivalence, and effectiveness as the predicate
device. The differences above between the proposed device and predicate device do
not affect the intended use, technology characteristics, safety, and effectiveness. And
no issues are raised regarding to safety and effectiveness. The proposed device is
determined to be Substantially Equivalent (SE) to the predicate device.
