The systems are full-featured Track 3 ultrasound systems, primarily for
general radiology use and specialized for OB/GYN with particular
features for real-time 3D/4D acquisition. They consist of a mobile console
with keyboard control panel; color LCD/TFT touch panel, color video
display and optional image storage and printing devices. They provide
high performance ultrasound imaging and analysis and have
comprehensive networking and DICOM capability. They utilize a variety
of linear, curved linear, matrix phased array transducers including
mechanical and electronic scanning transducers, which provide accurate
real-time three-dimensional imaging supporting all standard acquisition
modes.

Determination of Comparison to Predicates
Substantial Equivalence:
The proposed Voluson™ Performance 16 / Voluson™ Performance 18 is
substantially equivalent to the predicate devices. The following is an
overview of the differences between the Voluson™ Performance 16 /
Voluson™ Performance 18 and the predicate Voluson SWIFT Series
(K230346).

e The systems are all intended for diagnostic ultrasound imaging and

fluid flow analysis.

The proposed Voluson™ Performance 16/18 and predicate

Voluson SWIFT series systems have the same clinical intended
use.

© The proposed Voluson™ Performance 16/18 and predicate

Voluson SWIFT series systems have the similar imaging mode.

Voluson™ Performance 16/18 does not include the B-Flow mode.

e The systems are manufactured with materials which have been

evaluated and found to be safe for the intended use of the device.

e The systems have acoustic power levels which are below the

applicable FDA limits.

© The proposed Voluson™ Performance 16/18 and predicate

Voluson SWIFT series have similar capability in terms of

performing measurements, capturing digital images, reviewing and

reporting studies.

© The proposed Voluson™ Performance 16/18 and predicate

Voluson SWIFT series have been designed in compliance with

approved electrical and physical safety standards.

© The probes supported in proposed Voluson™ Performance 16/18

and predicate Voluson SWIFT series systems are identical.

¢ The proposed Voluson™ Performance 16/18 has had additional AI
software features which have been migrated from Voluson Expert
22/20/18 (K242168): SonoPelvicFloor 3.0, SonoAVCfollicle 2.0,
Fibroid Mapping, SonoLyst Live. During the migration of the
AI software features from Voluson Expert 22/20/18 (K242168) no
changes have been made to the algorithmic flow or the AI
components performing the inference. Each of the migrated AI
features has already been cleared on their respective applicable
probes. GEHC confirmed that the AI features work on the subject
device after migration with regression tests.

e The following software features have been migrated from Voluson
Expert 22/20/18 (K242168): O-RADS, Vscan Air Probe Support

e = The following software feature has been migrated from Voluson
Signature Series (K233692): Voice Control
