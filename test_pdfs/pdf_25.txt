Device Name

 

Vantage Galan 3T, MRT-3020, V10.0 with AiCE Reconstruction Processing Unit for MR

 

 

Indications for Use (Describe)

 

Vantage Galan 3T systems are indicated for use as a diagnostic imaging modality that produces
cross-sectional transaxial, coronal, sagittal, and oblique images that display anatomic structures of
the head or body. Additionally, this system is capable of non-contrast enhanced imaging, such as
MRA.

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images correspond to the spatial distribution of protons
(hydrogen nuclei) that exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR properties of body
tissues and fluids are:

«Proton density (PD) (also called hydrogen density)
*Spin-lattice relaxation time (T1)

*Spin-spin relaxation time (T2)

*Flow dynamics

*Chemical Shift

Depending on the region of interest, contrast agents may be used. When interpreted by a trained
physician, these images yield information that can be useful in diagnosis.

17. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

The Vantage Galan (Model MRT-3020) is a 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) System,
previously cleared under K230355. This system is based upon the technology and materials of
previously marketed Canon Medical Systems MRI systems and is intended to acquire and display cross-
sectional transaxial, coronal, sagittal, and oblique images of anatomic structures of the head or body.

18. SUMMARY OF CHANGE(S)

This submission is to report the following changes:

Summary of Hardware Changes:

Summary of So;

Summary of Accessory Chan

Magnet: New magnet (inhouse) is applied.

Gradient coil: New gradient coil is applied.

Real-time Platform: Real-time Platform is a new system architecture designed around new Real
time Manager (RTM) and it provides stable system performance with highspeed processing by
RTM.

are Changes:

AD Flow: 4D Flow Application provides the function of visualization of blood flow conditions by
combining with external analytical software. Quantitative analysis such as streamline, path line,
and velocity is available. Moreover, either Cine or Retro can be used together in PS3D, and PS
images with time-phase information can be obtained.

Zoom DWI: Zoom DWI Application offers diffusion images of smaller FOV size by selective
excitation and outer volume suppression (OVS). This application proposed to remove the
distortion and the aliasing artifact in PE direction.

3D-QALAS: 3D-QALAS (3D-quantification using an interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence
with T2 preparation pulse) is a scan technique that acquires signals with FFE3D using T2prep pulse
and IR pulse in combination. External analytical software is required for quantitative analysis.

 

Uninterruptible Power-supply System Kit: This option enables to protect storage such as HDDs
and SSDs by continuing to power the HOST-PC and SERVER-PC of the MRI system in the event
of a power outage.

INDICATIONS FOR USE

Vantage Galan 3T systems are indicated for use as a diagnostic imaging modality that produces cross-
sectional transaxial, coronal, sagittal, and oblique images that display anatomic structures of the head
or body. Additionally, this system is capable of non-contrast enhanced imaging, such as MRA.

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images correspond to the spatial distribution of protons (hydrogen
nuclei) that exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR properties of body tissues and fluids
are:

Proton density (PD) (also called hydrogen density)

Depending on the region of interest, contrast agents may be used. When interpreted by a trained
physician, these images yield information that can be useful in diagnosis.

SUMMARY OF DESIGN CONTROL ACTIVITIES

Risk Management activities for this modification are included in this submission. The test methods used
are the same as those submitted in the previously cleared submission of the predicate device, Vantage
Galan 3T, MRT-3020, V9.0 with AiCE Reconstruction Processing Unit for MR (K230355). A declaration of

SAFETY

This device is designed and manufactured under the Quality System Regulations as outlined in 21 CFR §
820 and ISO 13485 Standards.

This device is based upon the same technologies, materials and software as the predicate device. Risk
activities were conducted in concurrence with established medical device development standards and
guidance. Additionally, testing was done in accordance with applicable recognized consensus standards
published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for medical devices and the National
Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA):

TESTING

Risk analysis and verification/validation testing conducted through bench testing are included in this
submission which demonstrate that the system requirements have been met. Additionally, image
quality testing was completed which demonstrated that the subject device meets predetermined
acceptance criteria.

4D Flow: 4D Flow provides the function of visualization of blood flow conditions by combining with
external analytical software. Bench testing included velocity measurement in a phantom with known
flow values. Additionally, images in volunteers demonstrated velocity stream lines.

Zoom DWI: Zoom DWI offers diffusion images of smaller FOV size by selective excitation and outer
volume suppression (OVS). Zoom DWI was evaluated utilizing phantom images and representative
volunteer images to confirm that Zoom DWI is effective for suppressing wraparound artifacts, reducing
image distortion, providing accurate ADC values.

3D-QALAS: 3D-QALAS (3D-quantification using an interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence with T2
preparation pulse) is a scan technique that acquires signals with FFE3D using T2prep pulse and IR pulse
in combination. External analytical software is required for quantitative analysis. Bench testing included
scanning multiple volunteers and comparing, by three experienced reviewers, the resulting multiple
weighted images on image quality metrics such as overall contrast and signal strength against reference
images published in the literature.
