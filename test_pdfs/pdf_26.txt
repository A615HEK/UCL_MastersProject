IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma is a software workflow tool which uses an artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithm to identify suspected findings on non-contrast brain CT studies in the
medical care environment. The findings identified by the device include vasogenic edema.

Radiological findings are identified by the device using an AI algorithm — a convolutional neural
network trained using deep-learning techniques. Images used to train the algorithm were sourced from
datasets that included a range of equipment manufacturers and models. The performance of the
device’s AI algorithm was validated in a standalone performance evaluation, in which the case-level
output from the device was compared with a reference standard (‘ground truth’). This was determined
by two ground truthers, with a third truther used in the event of disagreement. All truthers were US
board-certified neuroradiologists.

The device interfaces with image and order management systems (such as PACS/RIS) to obtain non-
contrast brain CT studies for processing by the AI algorithm. Following processing, if any of the
radiological findings of interest are identified in a non-contrast brain CT study, the device provides a
notification to the image and order management system for prioritization of that study in the worklist.
This enables users to review the studies containing features suggestive of these radiological findings
earlier than in the standard clinical workflow. It is important to note that the device will never decrease
a study’s existing priority in the worklist. This ensures that worklist items will never have their
priorities downgraded based on AI results.

The device workflow is performed parallel to and in conjunction with the standard clinical workflow

for interpretation of non-contrast brain CTs. The device is intended to aid in prioritization and triage
of radiological medical images only.

population

The Indications for Use statement of the subject device differs to the predicate device only in the
clinical conditions of interest, however a standalone performance evaluation was conducted and
demonstrated that the device is as safe and effective for its intended use. Both the subject and predicate
device are intended for use to assist with worklist triage by providing notifications of suspected
findings and their associated priority.

VI. COMPARISON OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
WITH THE PREDICATE DEVICE

The subject device was evaluated and compared to the predicate device with respect to the following
characteristics:

1. Indications for Use

2. Anatomical site and modality

3. Intended user and clinical use environment

4. Technical method for notification and prioritization

5. Set of findings and algorithm

6. Device input and radiological image protocol

7. Device output and means of notification to user

8. System components

9. Location where results are received

10. Prioritization relationship to standard of care workflow

The following characteristics showed a difference between the subject and predicate devices. The
different characteristics include:

1. Set of findings

The difference between the subject and predicate device is the set of findings that the subject device
identifies. This difference does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness.

The performance of the subject device was addressed in standalone performance and triage

effectiveness evaluations and showed that the subject device is as safe and effective for its intended
use as the predicate device.

VII. PERFORMANCE DATA

The following performance data have been provided to support evaluation of substantial equivalence.
A. Software Verification and Validation Testing

Software verification and validation testing was conducted, and documentation was provided as
recommended by FDA’s Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, “Guidance for the Content of
Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices”, May 11, 2005.

B. Performance Testing

Performance of the subject device was assessed in a performance study to satisfy requirements set
forth in the special controls per 21CFR892.2080. These included standalone performance and triage
effectiveness evaluations.

Standalone performance was assessed via a retrospective, anonymized study of adult patient, DICOM-
compliant non-contrast brain CT cases. The test dataset used during the standalone performance
evaluation was newly acquired and independent from the training dataset used in model development.
The standalone performance study was conducted on an independent cohort which equated to a total
dataset of 167 cases for slice thickness <1.5mm (positive n=60 and negative n=107) and 293 cases for
slice thickness >1.5mm & <5.0mm (positive n=99 and negative n=194), collected consecutively from
five US hospital network sites. The cohort included representation across subgroups for patient
demographics (gender, age, ethnicity, race), technical parameters (imaging equipment make, model),
co-existing findings or abnormalities and mimics/challenging cases.

To determine the ground truth, each deidentified case was annotated in a blinded fashion by at least
two ABR-certified and protocol-trained neuroradiologists (ground truthers), with consensus
determined by two ground truthers and a third ground truther in the event of disagreement. The key
results of the study are summarized in the table below.

0.060584 94.9 (89.9, 99.0) 93.3 (89.7, 96.4)
0.094076 93.9 (88.9, 98.0) 94.3 (90.7, 97.4)
> 1.5mm & 5.0mm 0.145352 90.9 (84.8, 96.0) 95.4 oa or}
0.261255 89.9 (83.8, 94.9) 97.4 (94.8, 99.5)

 

 

 

 

The results demonstrate the subject device establishes effective triage within a clinician’s queue based
on high sensitivity and specificity. Further, these results are substantially equivalent to those of the
predicate device.

Triage effectiveness (turn-around time) was assessed by an internal bench study using a dataset of

n=277 cases positive for any of the findings eligible for prioritization. These cases were collected from
multiple data sources spanning a variety of geographical locations, patient demographics and technical

Page 5

characteristics. The results demonstrated a triage turn-around time of 81.6 (95%CI: 80.3 — 82.9)
seconds, which is substantially equivalent to the total performance time published for the predicate
device.

Therefore, the subject device has been shown to satisfy the performance requirements per
21CFR892.2080, for ‘Radiological computer aided triage and notification software’, by providing
clinically effective triage for non-contrast brain CT studies containing features suggestive of
radiological findings of interest. This data demonstrates the subject device is as safe and effective for
its intended use as the predicate device, and thereby supports substantial equivalence.

VIII.CONCLUSIONS

The subject device and the predicate device are both software only packages, devices intended to
assist with worklist triage by providing notification of findings. The subject and predicate devices
utilize the same principles of operation and work in parallel to the current standard of care workflow.

Both the subject and predicate devices use an artificial intelligence algorithm to identify findings in
images and require the same inputs (DICOM image data) and provide the same outputs (prioritization
for a medical worklist).

The technological differences between the subject and predicate devices do not raise new questions of
safety and effectiveness.

Standalone performance testing and the comparison of technological characteristics with the predicate
device shows that the subject device:

e performs as intended,

e is as safe and effective for its intended use as the predicate device, and
e is therefore substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
