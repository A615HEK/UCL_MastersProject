5. Device Description

uAI Portal is a comprehensive software solution designed to process, review and analyze
CT studies. It can transfer images in DICOM 3.0 format over a medical imaging network
or local file system. These images can be functional data, as well as anatomical datasets.
It can be at one or more time-points or include one or more time-frames. Multiple display
formats including VR, MIP, MPR, Probe, CPR, and SCPR. A trained, licensed physician
can interpret these displayed images as well as the statistics as per standard practice.

uAI Portal contains the following applications:
* The Lower Extremity Vessel Analysis
* The Head and Neck Vessel Analysis
¢ The Coronary Analysis
* The Pulmonary Artery Analysis
* The Aorta Analysis

7. Summary of Technological Characteristics

uAI Portal offers a fast and user-friendly solution for reconstructing medical images
by utilizing automatic segmentation results generated by artificial intelligence
algorithms.

The system parses DICOM images, extracts some tags and then fill the information
to database. Datachecking is performed based on the information to verify whether
the data can be processed by any of the application. Then the algorithms will be
called to process the images in memory and output the segmented results. The
segmented results will be stored in hard drive. The system uses database to retrieve
the information and record some operation status.

Once users select any data and choose one application, the application will start and
load the images files to memory. The original images and the processing results can
be displayed in the software interface. Various types of views depending on the
selected application are displayed by respective algorithms in the software interface.
Basic operations like zooming, panning, adjusting window, and measurements can be
performed on the displayed images. Users have the options to save images or results
to PACS for storage or send them to Filming for printing. Additionally, user
configuration is provided, allowing users to customize their settings in each
application.

Both the proposed and predicate device have the similar general information, such as
Device Classification Name, Product Code, Classification Panel, Intended Use
described in Table 1.

The proposed and predicate device also have the same advanced applications in
following:

* Lower Extremity Vessel Analysis

* Head and Neck Vessel Analysis

* Coronary Analysis

* Pulmonary Artery Analysis

* Aorta Analysis

The differences between the proposed and the predicate device are listed as follows:

* The CT Vessel Analysis application of the predicate device includes the Aorta
Analysis application, Head and Neck Vessel Analysis application, Lower
Extremity Vessel Analysis application and Pulmonary Artery Analysis

application of the proposed device; The CT Heart application of the predicate
device offer similar functions as Coronary Analysis application of the proposed
device.

The CT Vessel Analysis application of the predicate device provides combined
segmentation results of vessels and inseparable parts of organs, whereas the
proposed device provides segmentation results of vessels in the Aorta Analysis
application and Pulmonary Artery Analysis application.

During the ground truthing process, two Chinese radiologists, each with at least 5
years of clinical experience, independently annotated vessel mask for each patient

case, resulting in two sets of annotations per case. Both radio!

 

logists are hospital

employees and are independent from United Imaging. After completion, an American
Board-Certified Radiology adjudicator with at least 10 years of clinical experience
reviewed both sets of segmented images. Based on his assessment, the adjudicator
selected the most accurate segmentation set as the final ground truth. If needed, he
would make any necessary modification until a satisfactory ground truth was

established for the study.

The results output by algorithm were compared with the reference standard, the value
of Dice coefficient were shown in the table below:
