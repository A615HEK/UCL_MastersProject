Device Description Summary

21 CFR 807.92(a)(4)

 

6450 Ultrasound System is a general-purpose diagnostic ultrasound system, based on a mainframe platform that can be easily moved

thanks to four swivelling wheels.

6450 Ultrasound System consists of a control panel assembly with LCD monitor and a console with the device electronics and
connectors, housed in an ergonomic cart designed to be both highly mobile and adjustable for a range of users and operating

conditions.

6450 Ultrasound System use the physical properties of the ultrasound (i.e. sound waves with frequency above 20 kHz and that are not
audible to the human ear) for the visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses

 

 
 

directed into the tissues and of the Doppler effect, 1.e. the frequency-shifted ultrasound reflections produced by moving targets (usually
red blood cells) in the bloodstream, to determine both direction and velocity of blood flow in the target organs.

The primary modes of operation are: B-Mode, M-Mode, Tissue Enhancement Imaging (TEI), Multi View (MView), Doppler (both PW and
CW), Color Flow Mapping (CFM), Power Doppler, Tissue Velocity Mapping (TVM), Combined modes. 6450 Ultrasound System also
manages Elastosonography (ElaXto, QElaXto, QElaXto 2D), 3D/4D and CnTI.

Several types of probes are used to cover different needs in terms of geometrical shape and frequency range.
6450 Ultrasound System can drive Phased Array, Convex Array, Linear Array, Doppler probes and Volumetric probes (Bi-Scan probes).
The control panel is equipped with a pull-out Qwerty alphanumeric keyboard that allows data entry. The touchscreen has an emulation
of the Qwerty keyboard that allows data entry and has additional controls and mode-depending keys, integrated in the touchscreen.
6450 Ultrasound System is equipped with wireless capability.

6450 Ultrasound System will be available on the market in two models with the following commercial names: MyLabE80, MyLabE85.
The difference between MyLabE80 and MyLabE85 models is only in the licenses configuration.

For both models, there is the ETC (Easy To Clean) version, having a keyboard with special controls and material, compatible with
disinfection procedures.

6450 Ultrasound System, defined herein, introduces new features and accessories listed below:

1. XStrain LA: XStrain allows clinicians to quantify endocardial velocities of contraction and relaxation and local deformation of the heart
(Strain/Strain rate). XStrain LA is an advanced processing package for the Left Atrium analysis.

2. New probe: IHX 6-25

6450 Ultrasound System employs the same fundamental technological characteristics as its predicate device cleared via K192157.

Summary of Testing, Strain Left Atrium (LA)

 

 

Description:

Strain functionality Left atrium (LA) with manual segmentation.

Medical Imaging, (that is part of Esaote S.p.A. group), using TomTec AutoSTRAIN (part of TomTec Arena TTA2 LOT 42.0) as prior
reference.

The validation is performed as follows:

1. A strain analysis is done for one complete heart cycle on each of the image runs described above, using the us_cardiac module. The
initial contour and corresponding frame index are equal to the ones used during the creation of the TomTec references, to ensure a
meaningful comparison.

2. The LASr, LAScd and LASct results for each image run are compared to the corresponding TomTec reference.

The ICC, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient result is valid for all Left Atrium Strain indexes (LASr, LAScd and LASct):
LASr = 0.84

LAScd = 0,76

LASct = 0,74

Demographics:
Patients with age > 18 years.

Clinical subgroups and confounders present in the dataset:
Patients with a variety of left ventricular functional states and subjects with normal cardiac function

 

 

 
 

 

including documented myocardial infarction within maximum two years before the study and patients with suspected or documented
coronary heart disease.

Equipments:
Esaote MyLabAlpha Ultrasounds system

GE Vivid E9 and Vivid E95 Ultrasounds systems
Esaote 6450 MyLabX8 ultrasound system

"Truthing” process:
For the clinical evaluation five batches of image data are used.

A batch of images was acquired using an Esaote MyLab Alpha system in the context of a multi-vendor strain comparison study
(Farsalinos, Daraban, Unlii, & Thomas, 2015).

The second batch of images was also acquired using an Esaote MyLab Alpha system in the context of multi-vendor strain comparison
study (Mirea, et al., 2018).

The third batch of images was acquired at the cardiology department of the Amsterdam Medical Center by experienced cardiographers
The last batch of images was acquired at the cardiology department of Auxologico hospital Milan by experiences cardiographers
The study was approved by the ethical commission of the University Hospital Leuven
