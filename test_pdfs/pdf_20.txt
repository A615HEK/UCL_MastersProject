Intended Use/ Indications for Use

VELMENI for DENTISTS (V4D) is a concurrent-read, computer-assisted detection software
intended to assist dentists in the clinical detection of dental caries, fillings/restorations, fixed
prostheses, and implants in digital bitewing, periapical, and panoramic radiographs of permanent
teeth in patients 15 years of age or older. This device provides additional information for dentists
in examining radiographs of patients’ teeth. This device is not intended as a replacement for a
complete examination by the dentist or their clinical judgment that considers other relevant
information from the image, patient history, or actual in vivo clinical assessment. Final diagnoses
and patient treatment plans are the responsibility of the dentist.
Device Description
V4D software medical device comprises of the following key components:
e Web Application Interface delivers front-end capabilities and is the point of interaction
between the device and the user.

e Machine Learning (ML) Engine delivers V4D’s core ML capabilities through the
radiograph type classifier, condition detection module, tooth numbering module, and
merging module.

e Backend API allows interaction between all the components, as defined in this section,
in order to fulfill the user's requests on the web application interface.

e Queue receives and stores messages from Backend API to send to Al-Worker.

e Al-Worker accepts radiograph analysis requests from Backend API via the Queue,
passes gray scale radiographs to the ML Engine in the supported extensions (jpeg and
png), and returns the ML analysis results to the Backend API.

e Database and File Storage store critical information related to the application, including
user data, patient profiles, analysis results, radiographs, and associated data.

The following non-medical interfaces are also available with VELMENI for DENTISTS (V4D):
e VELMENI BRIDGE (VB) acts as a conduit enabling data and information exchange
between Backend API and third-party software like Patient Management or Imaging
Software
e Rejection Review (RR) module captures the ML-detected conditions rejected by dental

professionals to aid in future product development and to be evaluated in accordance
with VELMENIs post-market surveillance procedure.

Substantial Equivalence
The proposed VELMENI for DENTISTS (V4D) has similar indications for use to, and uses the
same fundamental technology as, the legally marketed predicate device to which substantial
equivalence is claimed, the Overjet Caries Assist (K2222746) device. Reference devices are
included for comparison for detection features and image types.

Technological Characteristics
As shown in Table 1 above, the proposed VELMENI for DENTISTS (V4D) device and the predicate
device have similar indications for use and uses the same fundamental technology (i.e., machine
learning technology). Differences in technological characteristics include that each device uses its
own proprietary algorithm to analyze digital radiographs. The proposed device's output is not limited
to caries but includes restorations, fixed prostheses, and implants. Reference devices were
identified because they demonstrate the Agency’s familiarity with computer-assisted technology and
the ability to identify and detect conditions beyond caries and in radiographs other than bitewing and
periapical. The differences in technological characteristics do not raise new or different questions of
safety or effectiveness.

The proposed device and the predicate device are technologically equivalent as follows:

Both devices are designed to process digital bitewing and periapical radiographs.
Both devices use neural network-based computer algorithms.

Both devices mark detections within the user interface with a graphical overlay on the
radiograph.

Both devices produce near-instantaneous detection results.

Both devices are for prescription use.

Both devices utilize cloud-hosted solutions.
The proposed device and the predicate device are technologically different as follows:

e The proposed device can detect other dental features (i.e., restorations, fixed prostheses,
and implants) in addition to dental caries. The ability to detect other dental features has been
cleared in other devices within this same regulation and product code.

e The proposed device is capable of making detections in panoramic radiographs in addition to
the bitewing and periapical radiographs. The ability to detect dental features in panoramic
radiographs has been cleared in other devices within the same regulation and product code.

e The proposed device will be used on patient images from 15 years old or older with
permanent teeth. The use of the device in patients as young as 12 years of age with
permanent teeth has already been cleared within the predicate device.

e Once suspected findings are detected in a radiograph, the proposed device overlays the
radiograph with segmentation on the radiograph or alternatively a bounding box outlining the
detected regions of suspected caries, restorations, fixed prosthesis, and implants, while
predicate device does so with segmented polygons outlining the detected regions of
suspected caries or fills suspected caries.

e The proposed device utilizes a different list of compatibility of image types as compared to
the predicate device.

e Clinical Performance

Velmeni evaluated the performance of Velmeni for Dentists (V4D) in a multi-reader fully crossed
reader improvement study. 12 US licensed dentists were asked to evaluate 600 bitewing images
(total caries 315), 597 periapical images (total caries 271) and 600 panoramic images (total caries
853). Ground truth was established by the consensus labels of three US licensed dentists, and non-
consensus labels were adjudicated by an oral radiologist. Half of the data set contained unannotated
images, and the second half contained radiographs that had been processed through the V4D
model. Radiographs were presented to readers in alternating groups. In Session 1, readers were
asked to outline suspected caries, fixed prosthesis, implant, and restorations and to review
predictions from the V4D model. Each reader was asked to provide a rating of 25 - 100 for their
confidence in the annotation (25 for lowest confidence, up to 100 for highest confidence). A 4-week
washout period was utilized to limit recollection bias. Following the washout, the readers were
presented with the same data set but with alternate grouping. i.e., if a reader saw a radiograph in the
unpredicted state in session 1, they were presented with the same radiograph with V4D predictions
in session 2, and vice versa. Results were compared against a consensus ground truth, and the
sensitivity, specificity, and weighted alternative free response receiver operating characteristic
(wAFROC) were evaluated to characterize the performance of the readers with (assisted) and
without (unassisted) viewing the model annotations.

Findings were first summarized at the lesion level and then at the case (view) level. The V4D software
demonstrated clear benefit for bitewing and periapical views in all features. The panoramic view
demonstrated benefit though the absolute benefit for caries sensitivity was smaller due to lower overall
reader performance. In addition, for the panoramic view, there was a benefit in restoration sensitivity

that was somewhat offset by a drop in image-level specificity.

Conclusion

Velmeni Inc. has the same intended use as the predicate device, specifically to detect pathological
and/or non-pathological conditions on dental radiographs for use by trained dental professionals.
While there are some small differences in technological characteristics between the proposed device,
VELMENI for DENTISTS (V4D), and the predicate device, these differences do not raise different
questions of safety and effectiveness. The results of the stand-alone and MRMC reader studies
demonstrate that the performance of V4D is as safe, as effective, and performs equivalent to that of
the predicate device, and VELMENI has demonstrated that the proposed device complies with
applicable Special Controls for Medical Image Analyzers. Therefore, VELMENI for DENTISTS (V4D)
can be found substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
