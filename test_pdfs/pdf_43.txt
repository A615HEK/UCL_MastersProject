Ml. Device Description

The R-Trigger algorithm software feature on Philips EPIQ and Affiniti Ultrasound System is intended to
support detection of R-wave peak (R-trigger) as an input to certain TTE clinical applications, initially
including AutoStrain LV, AutoEF, 2D Auto LV (collectively referred to as “AutoStrain”), and
AutoMeasure applications. The R-trigger algorithm is planned to be implemented as workflow
enhancement for transthoracic clinical applications on EPIQ and Affiniti Ultrasound Systems in the
M13 software release.

The Auto-Measure and AutoStrain features, cleared on Philips EPIQ and Affiniti systems (K211597,
K190913 resp.) support users during B-mode (2D), CW-, PW- and TDI-Doppler measurements by
automating some of the measurements needed to complete a routine transthoracic echo (TTE) exam
for adult patients.

The current AutoMeasure and AutoStrain applications require input from physio signal (ECG) using
electrodes, because the modules and their detectors work on single cardiac cycles, starting and ending
with the End Diastole (ED) or more precisely with delimiting R-trigger events as a good approximation.
Determining the R-triggers is currently done on the EPIQ and Affiniti Ultrasound Systems by a dedicated
physio board. However, in some cases, the physio signal is not available, either because it was never
obtained or because the data were not saved. To enable clinical users to be able to use AutoMeasure
and AutoStrain application without the R-trigger (ECG based) input, R-trigger feature (non-ECG-based)
has been developed.

There are no hardware changes to the EPIQ and Affiniti systems due to change to the introduction of
the R-Trigger software application.

The software application is supported by all EPIQ and Affiniti models running software version 13.0 or
higher.

Vi. Safety Considerations

The proposed EPIQ Series Diagnostic Ultrasound System and Affiniti Series Diagnostic Ultrasound
System, including R-Trigger software application, and compatible transducers are all Track 3 Devices
and comply with the referenced standards as well as the FDA ultrasound guidance document, Guidance
for Industry and FDA Staff — Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and Transducers,
issued in February 2023.

VIL. Nonclinical Performance Data

The proposed modification of the EPIQ Series Diagnostic Ultrasound System and Affiniti Series
Diagnostic Ultrasound was tested in accordance with Philips internal procedures. Philips Ultrasound
tested the subject devices per the following standards to ensure the continued safe and effective
performance:

e IEC 62304 Medical device software — Software life cycle processes, 2006 + A 2015
e 1SO 14971 Medical devices- Application of risk management to medical devices, 2019

Non-clinical verification testing was conducted to address the change and performance test data were
provided to support the introduction of the subject R-Trigger software application. The activities to
assure the safe and effective performance of the software revision included, but are not limited to, the
following:

e Requirements Review

e Risk Analysis and Management Review
e Product Specification Review

e Design Reviews

Non-clinical testing also included the Performance Validation Study for the proposed R-Trigger software
application.

A retrospective data analysis study was executed to evaluate the performance of R-trigger Al based
software in detection of R-wave time stamp and subsequent input of the time stamp into AutoMeasure
and AutoStrain applications’ clinical outputs. The study was executed on cardiac TTE clips acquired
with Philips Ultrasound systems from a diverse set of subject demographics, body habitus and
parameters’ distribution. There were 3 primary endpoints in the study. Primary endpoint #1 evaluated
the performance of the R-Trigger (non-ECG) algorithm in isolation, primary endpoints #2 and #3
evaluated the clinical impact of the R-Trigger algorithm outputs, which were used as an input to the
AutoMeasure and AutoStrain clinical application, respectively. Total of 35 hypotheses covering 3
endpoints were tested in this study in a pre-defined hierarchical order with pre-defined acceptance
criteria. A total of 7309 cardiac clips from 3964 were used for analysis of R-trigger Al-based algorithm
covering the 3 endpoints. The demographic for the subjects associated with the clips included in the
study are presented in the tables below and additionally refer to Table 6 and Table 7 for detail different
market regions stratified by demographics and age and BMI stratification by modes:

In addition, the performance of the software was accessed in analysis stratified by demographic
variables (age, BMI, gender and race) and clinical status (healthy, suspected of disease).

The results of the 35 hypotheses demonstrated high agreement of R-trigger Al based algorithm in both
technical and clinical assessments when compared to ECG-based R-trigger. The mean differences,
inclusive of 95% confidence intervals, reported in the study for all endpoints fall within the clinical

 
PHILIPS

ranges, as such the clinical acceptability for the bias (mean difference) is also met.

The study results produced confidence intervals for the limits of agreement and correlation, for each
parameter (hypothesis) tested, meeting the pre-defined acceptance criteria for the study. The results
for all three primary endpoints are shown below:

Total of 35 hypotheses covering 3 endpoints were tested in this study in a pre-defined order with pre-
defined acceptance criteria. Study produced confidence intervals for the limits of agreement and
correlation, for each parameter (hypothesis) tested, meeting the pre-defined acceptance criteria for
the study. Lastly, both AutoMeasure and AutoStrain applications are semi-automated quantitative
imaging tools and users are generally expected to review and concur with the initialization and
generated results. The users can also edit the application(s) generated measurements and outputs
based on their clinical expertise.

Since this is a software-only change and no new hardware was added, no acoustic output, cleaning
and disinfectants, thermal, electrical, electromagnetic, and mechanical safety testing were required.
Biocompatibility testing is not needed for the subject EPIQ Series Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and
Affiniti Series Diagnostic Ultrasound with R-Trigger. The transducer patient contact materials and
manufacturing processes are not impacted by the release of the subject EPIQ Series Diagnostic
Ultrasound System and Affiniti Series Diagnostic Ultrasound with R-Trigger.

Vill. Clinical Data

There was no clinical investigation needed for this premarket submission of the EPIQ Series Diagnostic
Ultrasound Systems and Affiniti Series Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems with R-Trigger software
application.

Ix. Sterilization

Not applicable. The ultrasound transducers are not supplied sterile.

x. Conclusion

Results of the testing show that the proposed subject device meets its intended use support a
determination that the proposed subject device does not raise new questions of safety or effectiveness.

Therefore, the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device in terms of indications
for use, design, technological characteristics, modes of operations, safety, and effectiveness.
