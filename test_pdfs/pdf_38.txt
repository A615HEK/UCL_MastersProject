The subject device, Clever One, is a software product designed to combine the functionality of
two predicate devices, EzDent-i and Ez3D-i. EzDent-i provides 2D imaging capabilities, while
Ez3D-i offers 3D imaging capabilities. Clever One integrates the technologies of these two
devices to support both 2D and 3D imaging, resulting in a unified platform for medical imaging.

1. Technological Comparison:
Clever One adopts the same technological principles as EzDent-i and Ez3D-i, utilizing

DICOM image formats and digital image input sources. The combined technology

enables Clever One to provide both 2D and 3D imaging functionalities, which align

 

directly with the features offered by the predicate devices. All major functionalities—
including bone density analysis and implant simulation—are identical to those of the
predicate devices EzDent-I and Ez3D-I.

Principle of Operation:

The operation of Clever One is substantially equivalent to EzDent-i and Ez3D-i. Clever
One inherits the 2D imaging capabilities from EzDent-i and the 3D imaging capabilities
from Ez3D-i without introducing new principles of operation.

Software and Platform:

All devices, including Clever One, operate on a Windows-based platform using Windows
10 as the operating system. The integration of functionalities does not alter the
fundamental platform compatibility.

User Interface and Functional Enhancements:

The user interface of Clever One integrates and enhances the graphical interfaces of
EzDent-i and Ez3D-i to support 2D and 3D imaging in a seamless manner. This
enhancement does not introduce new risks or functionalities beyond those already
established by the predicates.

5. Safety and Effectiveness:
The combined functionalities of Clever One do not raise new questions regarding safety
or effectiveness. The system builds upon validated features of EzDent-i and Ez3D-i,
ensuring that the overall safety profile remains consistent with the predicates.

Conclusion:

Clever One is substantially equivalent to the predicate devices EzDent-i (K241114) and Ez3D-
i (K231757) in terms of technology, principle of operation, platform, and functional
capabilities. The integration of 2D and 3D imaging does not introduce new technological
characteristics that would require additional validation beyond that conducted for the
predicate devices.

Technological Characteristics:

Clever One is a software device that does not contact the patient, nor does it control any
life sustaining devices. Results produced by the software’s diagnostic, treatment planning
and simulation tools are dependent on the interpretation of trained and licensed
radiologists, clinicians and referring physicians as an adjunctive to standard radiology
practices for diagnosis.

Performance Data:

SW verification/validation and the measurement accuracy test were conducted to establish
the performance, functionality and reliability characteristics of the subject devices. The
device passed all of the tests based on pre-determined Pass/Fail criteria.

The subject device incorporates a new platform that features network and cloud
connectivity. In accordance with the FDA's guidance document, "Cybersecurity in Medical
Devices: Quality System Considerations and Content of Premarket Submissions,"
comprehensive cybersecurity risk management and verification and validation activities
were conducted. The results of these cybersecurity assessments, the supporting
documentation, and the cybersecurity management plan are included in this premarket
submission.

Conclusion:

The subject device is substantially equivalent in the areas of technical characteristics,
general function, application, and indications for use. The new device does not introduce a
fundamentally new scientific technology, and the device has been validated through system
level test. Therefore, we conclude that the subject device described in this submission is
substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
