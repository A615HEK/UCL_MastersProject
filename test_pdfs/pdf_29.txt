IV. DEVICE DESCRIPTION

Annalise Enterprise CTB Triage Trauma is a software workflow tool which uses an artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithm to identify suspected findings on non-contrast brain CT studies in the
medical care environment. The findings identified by the device include acute subdural/ epidural
hematoma, acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, intra-axial hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Radiological findings are identified by the device using an AI algorithm — a convolutional neural
network trained using deep-learning techniques. Images used to train the algorithm were sourced from
datasets that included a range of equipment manufacturers including Toshiba, GE Medical Systems,
Siemens, Philips, and Canon Medical Systems. This dataset, which contained over 200,000 CT brain
imaging studies, was labelled by trained radiologists regarding the presence of the four findings of
interest.

The performance of the device’s AI algorithm was validated in a standalone performance evaluation,
in which the case-level output from the device was compared with a reference standard (‘ground
truth’). This was determined by two ground truthers, with a third truther used in the event of
disagreement. All truthers were US board-certified neuroradiologists.

The device interfaces with image and order management systems (such as PACS/RIS) to obtain non-
contrast brain CT studies for processing by the AI algorithm. Following processing, if any of the
clinical findings of interest are identified in a non-contrast brain CT study, the device provides a
notification to the image and order management system for prioritization of that study in the worklist.
This enables users to review the studies containing features suggestive of these clinical findings earlier
than in the standard clinical workflow. It is important to note that the device will never decrease a
study’s existing priority in the worklist. This ensures that worklist items will never have their priorities
downgraded based on AI results.

The device workflow is performed parallel to and in conjunction with the standard clinical workflow

for interpretation of non-contrast brain CTs. The device is intended to aid in prioritization and triage
of radiological medical images only.

The Indications for Use statement of the subject device differs to the predicate device only in the
clinical conditions of interest, however a standalone performance evaluation was conducted and
demonstrated that the device is as safe and effective for its intended use. Both the subject and predicate
device are intended for use to assist with worklist triage by providing notifications of suspected

findings and their associated priority.

VI. COMPARISON OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
WITH THE PREDICATE DEVICE

The subject device was evaluated and compared to the predicate device with respect to the following
characteristics:

1. Indications for Use

2. Anatomical site and modality

3. Intended user and clinical use environment

4. Technical method for notification and prioritization

5. Device input and radiological image protocol

6. System components

7. Location where results are received

8. Prioritization relationship to standard of care workflow
9. Ability to support effective triage

10. Device output and means of notification to user

The following characteristics showed a difference between the subject and predicate devices. The
different characteristics include:

1. Set of findings and algorithm
The difference between the subject and predicate device is the set of findings that the subject device
identifies and the underlying artificial intelligence algorithm. The performance of the subject device

algorithm for each of the findings was addressed in a standalone performance evaluation and showed
that the subject device is as safe and effective for its intended use as the predicate device.

VII. PERFORMANCE DATA

The following performance data have been provided to support evaluation of substantial equivalence.
A. Software Verification and Validation Testing

Software verification and validation testing was conducted, and documentation was provided as
recommended by FDA’s Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, “Guidance for the Content of
Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices”, May 11, 2005.

B. Performance Testing

Performance of the subject device was assessed in four performance studies to satisfy requirements set
forth in the special controls per 21CFR892.2080. These included standalone performance and triage
effectiveness evaluations.

Standalone performance was assessed via a retrospective, anonymized study of adult patient, DICOM-
compliant non-contrast brain CT cases. The test dataset used during the standalone performance
evaluation was newly acquired and independent from the training dataset used in model development.
The standalone performance study was conducted on four independently assessed cohorts which
equated to a total dataset of 1,485 cases for slice thickness <1.5mm (positive n=1,003 and negative
n=482) and 1,878 cases for slice thickness >1.5mm & <5.0mm (positive n=1,257 and negative n=621),
collected consecutively from five US hospital network sites.

The performance testing datasets included representation across subgroups for patient demographics
(gender [female: 44.9-52.2%, male: 47.8-55.1%], age [mean: 66.5-68.0 years, min: 22, max: 99-105],
ethnicity [Hispanic: 5.9-11.3%], race [White/Caucasian: 76.6-82.1%, Other: 13.6-19.3%, Unknown:
2.7-6.9%]), co-existing findings or abnormalities and technical parameters (imaging equipment make,
model). The datasets included GE Healthcare, Siemens and Toshiba CT scanners for the pivotal study.
Additional analyses were conducted with GE, Philips, Siemens and Toshiba scanners to demonstrate
the generalizability of the device.

  

To determine the ground truth, each deidentified case was annotated in a blinded fashion by at least
two ABR-certified and protocol-trained neuroradiologists (ground truthers), with consensus
determined by two ground truthers and a third ground truther in the event of disagreement. The key
results of the study are summarized in the table below.

The results demonstrate the subject device establishes effective triage within a clinician’s queue based
on high sensitivity and specificity. Further, these results are substantially equivalent to those of the
predicate device.

Triage effectiveness (turn-around time) was assessed by an internal bench study using a dataset of
n=277 cases positive for any of the findings eligible for prioritization. These cases were collected from
multiple data sources spanning a variety of geographical locations, patient demographics and technical
characteristics. The results demonstrated a triage turn-around time of 81.6 (95% CI: 80.3 — 82.9)
seconds, which is substantially equivalent to the total performance time published for the predicate
device.

Therefore, the subject device has been shown to satisfy the performance requirements per
21CFR892.2080, for ‘Radiological computer aided triage and notification software’, by providing
clinically effective triage for non-contrast brain CT studies containing features suggestive of clinical
findings of interest. This data demonstrates the subject device is safe and effective for its intended use,
and thereby supports substantial equivalence.

VIII.CONCLUSIONS

The subject device and the predicate device are both software only packages, devices intended to
assist with worklist triage by providing notification of findings. The subject and predicate devices
utilize the same principles of operation and work in parallel to the current standard of care workflow.

Both the subject and predicate devices use an artificial intelligence algorithm to identify findings in
images and require the same inputs (DICOM image data) and provide the same outputs (prioritization
for a medical worklist).

The technological differences between the subject and predicate devices do not raise new questions of
safety and effectiveness.

Standalone performance testing and the comparison of technological characteristics with the predicate
devices shows that the subject device:

e performs as intended,

e is safe and effective for its intended use, and
e is therefore substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
