ADVANCED RECONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND VALIDATION

 

Performance analysis and validation of the subject device Advanced Reconstruction models was
performed using a test dataset entirely independent from the dataset used for model training. The test
dataset comprises a total of 58 individual subjects and 313 unique images collected using sequence
types available on the subject device. For each subject, a subset of the following sequences, chosen
appropriately for the indication for imaging, was scanned: T1 Gray-White, T1 Standard, T2, T2 Fast,
FLAIR, FLAIR Fast, DWI, DWI Fast (DWI b=0, b=900, ADC). Axial, Sagittal, and Coronal orientations were
included; for DWI sequences, only Axial was available. A description of the acceptance criteria and
subset of data used for each test is included in the test summaries below.

In all cases, models are trained and validated with MRI data and images as the only inputs and outputs;
there are no confounding factors and clinical subgroups are not defined or considered. While gender
and age are available for most subjects, age, gender, ethnic background, and pathology are not
expected to influence model architecture.

Performance Analysis:

Study Design:
Advanced Reconstruction was assessed for robustness, stability, and generalizability over a variety of
subjects, design parameters, artifacts, and scan conditions using reference-based metrics.

Aset of images including Swoop data, high field images, and synthetic contrast images, was used as
ground truth target images. Test input data (synthetic k-space generated from the target images) was
reconstructed using both Advanced and Linear Reconstruction, and the similarity to the original ground
truth image was compared between the two reconstruction methods. Reconstruction outputs with
motion and zipper artifacts were qualitatively assessed.

Reference Standard and Metrics:

Normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) were used to compare the
ability of Advanced Reconstruction to reproduce the ground truth image compared to Linear
Reconstruction.

Study Results:
For all models and all test datasets NMSE was reduced and SSIM was improved for Advanced

Reconstruction test images compared to Linear Reconstruction test images. Advanced Reconstruction
preserved the presentation of motion and zipper artifacts, and no unexpected output was observed.
Contrast-to-Noise Ratio Validation

Study Design:

Regions of interest (ROI) encompassing pathologies were annotated and reviewed by two American
Board of Radiology (ABR) certified radiologists. The contrast-to-noise of hyper- and hypo- intense
pathologies were measured with respect to healthy white matter tissue from the same image. The
inclusion criterion for images used for this study was at least one visible pathology.

Reference Standard and Metrics:

Linear Reconstruction was used as the reference standard for the comparison. Contrast-to-Noise Ratio
(CNR) between pathology and healthy tissues was measured to quantify how accurately pathology
features are preserved by Advanced Reconstruction.

The mean CNR of Advanced Reconstruction was required to be greater than the mean CNR of the
baseline Linear Reconstruction at statistical significance level of 0.05 for each sequence type.

Dataset and Sample Size:

A minimum of 16 images per model type (sequence group) were included for lesion annotation.
Pathologies spanning multiple slices were used multiple times. All annotated images were then
reviewed, and inaccurate ROI annotations were excluded from the analysis. The data meeting inclusion
criteria are described below.

*Partially anonymized

Study Results:

In all cases, CNR of Advanced Reconstruction was greater than or equal to Linear Reconstruction for
both hyper- and hypo-intense pathologies. The study result demonstrates that Advanced Reconstruction
does not unexpectedly modify, remove, or reduce the contrast of pathology features.
Advanced Reconstruction Image Validation

Study Design:

Five external, ABR-certified radiologists representing clinical users were asked to review side-by-side
clinical image sets taken with the subject Swoop System, reconstructed with both Advanced and Linear
Reconstruction. The reviewers rated the images using a five-point scale for image quality and the
consistency of diagnosis using both methods in the categories of noise, sharpness, contrast, geometric
fidelity, artifact, and overall image quality.

Reference Standard and Metrics:

Linear Reconstruction was used as the reference standard for the comparison. Advanced Reconstruction
was required to perform at least as well as Linear Reconstruction in all categories (median score 20 on
Likert scale) and perform better (21 on Likert scale) in at least one of the quality-based categories.

Dataset and Sample Si
Asample size of at least 16 was used per sequence. Within the sample dataset at least four cases for

each sequence-available image orientation (axial, sagittal, coronal) were used.

categories. This scoring indicates reviewers found Advanced Reconstruction improved image quality
while maintaining diagnostic consistency relative to Linear Reconstruction.
