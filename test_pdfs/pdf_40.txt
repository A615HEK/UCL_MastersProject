system to operate without wall power. Accuro 3S interfaces with healthcare IT networks to
implement DICOM-based patient and image archival workflows, with image storage in an external
PACS. The device utilizes a Dual-Array™ convex probe.

SpineNav-Al is an automated software tool that utilizes machine learning technologies to facilitate
workflows associated with musculoskeletal imaging assessments of the lumbar spine.

The Accuro 3S Dual-Array probe comprises a side-by-side convex transducer array design. Each
convex array has identical specifications: 64 elements, 3.5 - 4.0 MHz nominal center frequency,
480-micron pitch, and 50 mm radius of curvature.

Intended Use/Indications for Use:

The Accuro 3S is a diagnostic ultrasound imaging system for use by qualified and trained
healthcare professionals. Accuro 3S is intended to be used in a hospital or medical clinic
environment at the point of care.

Accuro 3S supports B-mode imaging and a SpineNav-Al™ image processing software. Accuro 3S
clinical applications include: musculoskeletal conventional and superficial, and guidance for
needle or catheter placement. A typical examination using Accuro 3S is guidance of neuraxial
anesthesia.

Comparison to Predicate Device(s):

Accuro 3S is substantially equivalent to the predicate device in terms of technological
characteristics and safety and effectiveness.

The Accuro 3S system intended use, intended user, patient population, and use environment are
shared with the predicate device, Accuro (K171594), and reference device, Venue (K220851).
Differences include the mechanical form factor of the Accuro 3S cart-based device, electronic
beamformer and computer hardware, and user interface design.

Key differences include the transducer type and SpineNav-Al software navigation tool.

The Dual-Array probe featured on Accuro 3S includes two standard PZT-based transducer arrays
with a convex geometry. The two arrays are aligned at the patient contact surface and physically
separated with a void, or ‘gap’, between the two convex arrays. Images from both convex arrays
are combined, or ‘compounded’, to create a single image in sector-scan format. Accuro (171594)
creates similar sector scan images but with a mechanically scanned single-element transducer.
Reference device, Venue (K220851) is cleared with a similar convex array transducer (probe name
C1-5-RS) with similar nominal center frequency around 3.5MHz, element number, and pitch. Non-
clinical testing for performance and safety has been conducted to ensure that no new risks are
introduced due to the geometrical differences. This includes performance testing and testing to
IEC 60601-2-37 and application of ISO 14971 for risk management.

SpineNav-Al is an improved version of SpineNav3D from predicate device, Accuro (K171594).
Whereas SpineNav3D utilizes an analytical algorithm based on template matching routines,
SpineNav-Al utilizes machine learning. The navigation tool supports the workflows associated with
musculoskeletal imaging assessments of the lumbar spine such as at the scouting stage of a
neuraxial anesthesia procedure. The scouting stage of a neuraxial anesthesia procedure is the
process of scanning the anatomy to orient the needle approach prior to placement of a catheter in
the epidural space or introduction of anesthetic material. The machine learning algorithm at the
foundation of SpineNav-Al is a deep convolutional neural network approach to segmenting certain
anatomical structures in the lumbar spine and conveying them by way of graphics to the user. A
measurement to the epidural space is provided in an identical manner to SpineNav3D on the
predicate Accuro (K171594) device. The machine learning algorithm for segmentation of anatomy
is similar to the cNerve feature on reference device Venue (K220851) which also segments
anatomy related to nerve blocks: popliteal, brachial, and femoral. Al testing was performed with
similar methodology to cNerve on the Venue (K220851) to ensure performance meets test criteria
and ISO 14971 for risk management was applied to design and labeling ensure that no new risks
are introduced.

Differences in design between the Accuro 3S and predicate device do not raise any new issues
related to safety or effectiveness.

Summary of Non-Clinical Tests:

The Accuro 3S has been evaluated for acoustic output, cleaning/disinfection and electrical,
thermal, mechanical, and EMC safety. The device has been found to conform to applicable medical
device safety standards. Patient contact materials are biocompatible.

Validation testing was performed to ensure that Accuro 3S meets the requirements of the
intended end users for specified clinical applications.

Al Summary of Tesi

SpineNav-Al™ image guidance software tool was validated on a test dataset comprising a diverse
range of demographic variables such as gender, age, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). Test
data were collected at seven (7) geographically diverse sites. The test dataset included 120
sequences and 10,080 image frames obtained from a total of 81 individuals.

Ground truth for anatomical labels were established from a panel of three board certified
radiologists. Generalizability of the results were assessed among subgroups for gender (M/F), age
(< 50/250), and BMI (< 25/2 25).

Since the intended use is anatomical feature tracking during scouting rather than feature
segmentation accuracy for diagnostic purposes, success criteria for each anatomical annotation
produced with SpineNav-Al were derived via a preliminary survey with intended users. The
preliminary survey established success criteria for per-frame accuracy, per-sequence detection
success rate, and DICE. Acceptance criteria for detection of each anatomical feature was 70% per-
frame accuracy and 80% per-sequence detection success rate. The range of per-frame accuracy
for all anatomical structures was 82.1% - 99.3%; the range of per-sequence detection success rate
for all anatomical structures was 91.7% - 100%; and the range of DICE scores for all anatomical
structures was 0.64 - 0.87.
re.

The Epidural Region Indicator, derived from SpineNav-Al anatomical segmentations, demonstrated
accuracy of 1.61 (+ 2.57) mm and 2.42 (+ 3.41) mm in the lateral and depth dimensions,
respectively, compared to the radiologist panel ground truth. Per-frame detection success rate of
the Epidural Region Indicator was 95.5%.

The data used in the training and tuning process comprised 25,536 images from 147 subjects and
is completely distinct from the test dataset used for validation.

Summary of Clinical Tests:

The subject of this premarket submission, Accuro 3S, did not require clinical studies to support the
determination of substantial equivalence.

Conclusion:
Accuro 3S exhibits the same technology characteristics and indications for use as legally marketed

predicate and reference devices and testing demonstrates substantially equivalent performance.
Therefore, Accuro 3S is substantially equivalent to the predicate device.
