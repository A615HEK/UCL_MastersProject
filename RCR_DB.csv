Findings are flagged when the ETT distal tip is assessed as being more than 5 cm above the carina, less than 2 cm above the carina, or when it is below the carina (i.e in the right or left mainstem bronchus). The device assesses solely the vertical position of the ETT distal tip relative to the carina, does not factor patient positioning, and cannot detect esophageal intubation. The device does not provide results when the carina is not well-visualized on the x-ray image.
