      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The device is called BunkerHill Health Inc.'s CAC (Calcium Angiography) device.\n",
      "* It is intended for use in cardiac care facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technical Specifications**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The device uses Computed Tomography (CT) scans to detect calcium deposits in the heart.\n",
      "* It has a specific algorithm for detecting calcium, which includes automatic detection and scoring of calcium deposits.\n",
      "* The device is designed to produce visual representations of detected calcium scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clinical Significance**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The device provides information on coronary artery disease risk categories, including CAC (Calcium Angiography) scores in 4 categories: 0-99 Hounsfield Units (HU), 100-399 HU, and two additional categories.\n",
      "* The device is intended to be used for routine care, with the goal of providing valuable information on cardiac health.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Performance Data**\n",
      "\n",
      "* A pivotal testing study was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CAC (gated) Device.\n",
      "* The study compared the device output with established ground truth values.\n",
      "* The device demonstrated an agreement rate of 95% or higher for each category, indicating that it is accurate and reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Comparison to Predicate Devices**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The device has similar indications, technological characteristics, and principles of operation as Imbio's CAC Software (K230112) and iCAC (K230223).\n",
      "* However, the device has some minor differences in indications, which do not affect its safety or effectiveness when used as labeled.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Based on the pivotal testing study and performance data analysis, the BunkerHill Health Inc. CAC (gated) Device is considered to be safe and effective.\n",
      "* The device is suitable for routine care and can provide valuable information on coronary artery disease risk categories.\n"
